Creates a new thread of execution to manage network
communications and initiate a connection with the appropriate
server. The function returns immediately, without blocking
on the success of the connection. The application may
then monitor the value returned by 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_active.html">is_active</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> to determine when the connection is actually established,
if at all. The application may also monitor transfer
statistics using 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$red_bytes.html">kdu_cache::get_transferred_bytes</A> and it may receive notification of network activity
by supplying a 
<A HREF="kdu$ifier.html">kdu_client_notifier</A>-derived object to the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__ins$notifier.html">install_notifier</A> function.
</P><P>
 The function creates an initial request queue to which
requests can be posted by 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> (in interactive mode &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#mode">mode</A>), returning the queue identifier. In interactive mode,
additional request queues can be created with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>, even before the request completes.
</P><P>
 Before calling this function, you might want to consider
overriding the default timeout values associated with
primary and/or auxiliary (see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A>) communication channels. By default, the primary connection
attempt times out after 3 seconds. If an auxiliary
TCP channel is granted in the reply, a further 5 seconds
is allowed to complete the auxiliary connection. These
parameters can be modified at any time via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__set$_timeout.html">set_primary_timeout</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__set$1_timeout.html">set_aux_tcp_timeout</A>.
</P><P>
 The network management thread is terminated once there
are no more alive request queues &mdash; request queues
are considered to be alive if the associated communication
channel is alive or in the process of being established.
One way to kill the network management thread is to
invoke 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A>, since this performs a hard close on all the open
communication channels. A more graceful approach is
to invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> function on all request queues (one by one, or all
at once). Request queues may also disconnect asynchronously
if their underlying communication channels are dropped
by the server or through some communication error.
</P><P>
 You may call this function again, to establish a new
connection. However, you should note that 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A> will be called automatically for you if you have not
already invoked that function. If a previous connection
was gracefully closed down through one or more successful
calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A>, the object may be able to re-use an established TCP
channel in a subsequent 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> attempt. For more on this, consult the description
of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> function.
</P><P>
 The present function may itself issue a terminal error
message through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> if there is something wrong with any of the supplied
arguments. For this reason, you should generally provide
try/catch protection when calling this function if
you don't want your application to die in the event
of a bad call.
</P>

A request queue identifier, which can be used with
calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_idle.html">is_idle</A> and quite a few other functions. In practice, when
you first connect to the server, the initial request
queue is assigned an identifier of 0, which is always
the value returned by this function.
</P><P>
 In summary, this function always returns 0 (or else
generates an error), but you should use the return
value in calls which require a request queue identifier
without assuming that the identifier is 0.

Holds the host name or IP literal address of the server
to be contacted, together with optional port information.
This string must follow the same conventions as those
outlined for the &lt;HOST&gt; and &lt;port&gt; components
of the string supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__che$ible_url.html">check_compatible_url</A>. Specifically, an optional decimal numeric &lt;port&gt;
suffix may appear at the end of the string, separated
by a colon, while the remainder of the string is either
a host name string (address to be resolved), a dotted
IPv4 literal address, or an IPv4 or IPv6 literal address
enclosed in square brackets. Host name strings are
hex-hex decoded prior to resolution.
</P><P>
 The default HTTP port number of 80 is assumed if none
is provided. Communication with the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#server">server</A> machine proceeds over HTTP, and may involve intermediate
proxies, as described in connection with the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#proxy">proxy</A> argument.
</P><P>
 This argument may be NULL only if the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A> argument is non-NULL, in which case 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A> must pass the test associated with the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__che$ible_url.html">check_compatible_url</A> function, and the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#server">server</A> string is obtained from the &lt;HOST&gt; and &lt;port&gt;
components of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A>.

<H4><A NAME="proxy">proxy</A> [<B>const char *</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Same syntax as 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#server">server</A>, but gives the host (and optionally the port number)
of the machine with which the initial TCP connection
should be established. This may either be the server
itself, or an HTTP proxy server. May be NULL, or point
to an empty string, if no proxy is to be used.
</P><P>
 As for 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#server">server</A>, the function anticipates potential hex-hex encoding
of any host name component of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#proxy">proxy</A> string and performs hex-hex decoding prior to any
host resolution attempts.

This argument may be NULL only if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A> is non-NULL, in which case the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A> string must pass the test associated with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__che$ible_url.html">check_compatible_url</A> and contain a valid &lt;resource&gt; sub-string; the
entire contents of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A>, commencing from the &lt;resource&gt; sub-string,
are interpreted as the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> in that case. In either case, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> string may not be empty.
</P><P>
 As explained in connection with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__che$ible_url.html">check_compatible_url</A>, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> string may consist of both a &lt;resource&gt; component
and a &lt;query&gt; component (the latter is optional)
and hex-hex encoding of each component is expected.
Hex-hex decoding of any query component is performed
separately on each request field, so that hex-hex encoded
'&' characters within the contents of any query field
will not be mistaken for query field separators.

<P>
If NULL or a pointer to an empty string or the string
"none", no attempt will be made to establish a JPIP
channel. In this case, no attempt will be made to establish
a stateful communication session; each request is delivered
to the server (possibly through the proxy) in a self-contained
manner, with all relevant cache contents identified
using appropriate JPIP-defined header lines. When used
in the interactive mode (see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#mode">mode</A>), this may involve somewhat lengthy requests, and
may cause the server to go to quite a bit of additional
work, re-creating the context for each and every request.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> holds the string "http" and the mode is interactive
(see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#mode">mode</A>), the client's first request asks for a channel with
HTTP as the transport. If the server refuses to grant
a channel, communication will continue as if the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> argument had been NULL.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> holds the string "http-tcp", the behaviour is the
same as if it were "http", except that a second TCP
channel is established for the return data. This transport
variant is somewhat more efficient for both client
and server, but requires an additional TCP channel
and cannot be used from within domains which mandate
that all external communication proceed through HTTP
proxies. If the server does not support the "http-tcp"
transport, it may fall back to an HTTP transported
channel. This is because the client's request to the
server includes a request field of the form "cnew=http-tcp,http",
giving the server both options.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> holds the string "http-udp", the behaviour is similar
to "http-tcp", except that the return data is transported
over an auxiliary UDP channel instead of a TCP channel.
This transport variant has the potential to be the
most efficient of all, since there is no unnecessary
delay incurred trying to order transmitted packets
or wait for the retransmission of lost packets. In
this mode, the client determines when UDP datagrams
are likely to have been lost and sends negative acknowledgement
messages at appropriate junctures. The server also
monitors UDP acknowledgement messages and implements
its own strategy for dealing with potentially lost
datagrams. As with "http-tcp", the client leaves the
server to monitor channel behaviour and implement appropriate
flow control. If the server does not support the "http-udp"
transport, it may fall back to an "http-tcp" scheme
or even a plain "http" transported channel. This is
because the client's request to the server includes
a request field of the form "cnew=http-udp,http-tcp,http",
giving the server all three options.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that wherever a channel is requested,
the server may respond with the address of a different
host to be used in all future requests; redirection
of this form is handled automatically by the internal
machinery.

If non-NULL, this argument provides the path name for
a directory in which cached data may be saved at the
end of an interactive communication session. The directory
is also searched at the beginning of an interactive
session, to see if information is already available
for the image in question. If the argument is NULL,
or points to an empty string, the cache contents will
not be saved and no previously cached information may
be re-used here. Files written to or read from the
cache directory have the ".kjc" suffix, which stands
for (Kakadu JPIP Cache). These files commence with
some details which may be used to re-establish connection
with the server, if necessary (not currently implemented)
followed by the cached data itself, stored as a concatenated
list of data-bins. The format of these files is private
to the current implementation and subject to change
in subsequent releases of the Kakadu software, although
the files are at least guaranteed to have an initial
header which can be used for version-validation purposes.

</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_MODE_NON_INTERACTIVE">KDU_CLIENT_MODE_NON_INTERACTIVE</A> &mdash; in this mode, all calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> are ignored and the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> string (or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A> string) is expected to express the application's interests
completely. In non-interactive mode, the client issues
a single request to the server and collects the response,
closing the channel upon completion. If the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#cache_dir">cache_dir</A> argument is non-NULL and there is at least one cache
file which appears to be compatible with the request,
the client executes exactly two requests: one to obtain
the target-id from the server, so as to determine the
compatibility of any cached contents; and one to request
the information of interest.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_MODE_AUTO">KDU_CLIENT_MODE_AUTO</A> &mdash; in this case, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> function automatically decides whether to use the
interactive or non-interactive mode, based on the form
of the request, as found in the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#compatible_url">compatible_url</A> arguments. If the request string contains a query
component (i.e., if it is of the form &lt;resource&gt;?&lt;query&gt;,
where "?" is the query separator), the &lt;query&gt;
string may contain multiple fields, each of the form
&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;, separated by the usual
"&" character. If a &lt;query&gt; string contains anything
other than the "target" or "subtarget" fields, the
non-interactive mode will be selected; otherwise, the
interacive mode is selected.

This optional argument allows you to avoid explicitly

<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> sub-strings from a compatible JPIP URL string, letting
