This object provides a mechanism for implementing a
potentially very efficient multi-threaded data processing
paradigm, based on the dependency propagation funcionality
provided by 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> derived objects. To understand this paradigm, we recommend
that you begin by thoroughly reading the discussion
appearing with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__dec$wait_safe.html">kdu_thread_entity::declare_first_owner_wait_safe</A> function and then read the discussion below.
</P><P>
 The basic idea behind the intended processing paradigm
is to perform all processing steps and calls that would
normally be performed by the group owner thread from
within a special "processor" job that can be scheduled
to run on any thread. Typically, a data processing
application either pulls image samples from 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> objects via 
<B>kdu_multi_synthesis::pull_line</B>, or else it pushes image samples to 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> objects via 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">kdu_multi_analysis::exchange_line</A>. Alternatively, the lower level 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> and/or 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> objects might be used; these derive from 
<A HREF="kdu$h_ifc.html">kdu_push_ifc</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$l_ifc.html">kdu_pull_ifc</A> and also offer data push/pull functions. The push/pull
calls must arrive in sequence and are normally generated
from a single thread, typically the owner of a thread
group, whose worker threads are internally deployed
to perform most of the work. In the processing paradigm
described here, these calls still arrive in sequence,
but they are delivered from within a special 
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A> object's job function, and the purpose of this present
object is to make sure that only one "processor" job
can be running at any given time. At the same time,
the object allows the processor job to be run on the
most appropriate thread, which may change over time.
This is achieved with the aid of the 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue__che$continue.html">check_continue</A> function.
</P><P>
 Here is how you would typically implement this processing
paradigm:
</P><UL><LI>
Pass an instance of the present object as the 
<B>env_queue</B> argument when constructing/creating push/pull objects
such as 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A>. This object collects dependency analysis information
passed on by those objects. The present object must
first be attached to the thread environment using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A> &mdash; more on this below.
</LI><LI>
Derive your own class from 
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A> and register the "processor" function using this object's
<A HREF="kdu$d_job__set_job_func.html">kdu_thread_job::set_job_func</A>. Generally, there will only be one 
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A> object, although there might be many instances of
the 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue.html">kdu_run_queue</A> object &mdash; you do not need to derive a new class
from 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue.html">kdu_run_queue</A>. Make sure that the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A>-derived object, or one that it knows about, maintains
sufficient state to pick up processing from where it
left off, because the "processor" job function needs
to be able to run for a while, return before all work
is complete, then be rescheduled and run again, potentially
on a different thread.
</LI><LI>
Provide a means for the group owner (or some other
"master" thread) to wait until all processing is done.
One way to do this (perhaps the best way) is to build
your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A> derived object on top of 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job.html">kdu_run_queue_job</A>, which offers 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__signal_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::signal_done</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A> functions. In the remainder of this description, we
will assume that this is what you do, although the
present object can be used with other job object designs.
You should arrange for the "processor" job to invoke
<B>signal_done</B> once all processing is complete. Make sure that your
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A>-derived object knows about all relevant 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue.html">kdu_run_queue</A> objects &mdash; these might even be created from within
your "processor" function.
</LI><LI>
Your "processor" function will typically perform the
push/pull calls on objects like 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> for which the present 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue.html">kdu_run_queue</A> object acts as a parent queue. Typically, each time
a line of image data has been pushed or pulled to all
relevant image components, your "processor" function
should invoke the all important 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue__che$continue.html">check_continue</A> function &mdash; this is an extremely inexpensive
call, implemented in-line, that often performs nothing
other than a simple comparison on a variable that is
likely to be in the calling thread's cache. If the
function returns true, you continue processing. If
the function returns false, your "processor" function
must return, without doing anything else, confident
in the knowledge that it will be scheduled to run again
once the potentially blocking conditions that caused
the false return have been cleared.
</LI><LI>
From your master control thread (typically the group
owner), invoke the 
<B>kdu_run_queue_job::do_job</B> function and then, once it returns, invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A>. If the initial call to your "processor" function
succeeded in doing all processing work before returning,
it will have invoked 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__signal_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::signal_done</A> and so the call to 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A> will return immediately. Otherwise, the "processor"
function terminated upon discovery of a potentially
blocking condition in some instance of the 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue.html">kdu_run_queue</A> class, but another instance of the job will be scheduled
once the blocking condition goes away, so that instance
of the "processing job", potentially running on a different
thread, will be the one that allows the call to 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A> to return. The 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A> function enters a "working wait state" by invoking
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition</A>. In this state, your master thread (typically the
group owner) itself may be the one that executes the
next instance of the "processor" function, or else
it may do other work within the system. In any event,
threads go idle only when there is no work anywhere
to be done and the first available thread will execute
the "processor" function as soon as the blocking dependencies
have been cleared.
</LI><LI>
Before you can schedule your special "processor" job
via this object, you need to do the following: 1) invoke
<A HREF="kdu$1queue__activate.html">activate</A>; 2) call 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A>, with the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> flag so that your "processor" job always runs in a
safe context; and 3) call 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__dec$wait_safe.html">kdu_thread_entity::declare_first_owner_wait_safe</A> some time before you first call 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A>, following the advice given above. Step 1 must be
performed before step 2 so that jobs can be scheduled.
Step 3 is optional, but always recommended so long
as the group owner is the one that calls 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A>. Moreover, if your thread group has only one thread
(the group owner), step 3 is required; otherwise, there
will be no context in which to run your "processor"
job. Step 3 would normally be performed immediately
before the call to 
<A HREF="kdu$e_job__wait_done.html">kdu_run_queue_job::wait_done</A> mentioned above.
</LI><LI>
Before attempting to invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> on a run queue that has been activated (see 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue__activate.html">activate</A>), you must explicitly call 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue__deactivate.html">deactivate</A>; otherwise, the call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> will sit around forever, waiting for the queue to
declare that it will no longer schedule any jobs.
</LI></UL><P>
 Note that this object never invokes the 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::propagate_dependencies</B> function, so it does not pass dependency information
up to parent queues. This is because the whole point
of the object is to catch dependency data and use it
to manage the scheduling of the special "processor"
function, through calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$1queue__che$continue.html">check_continue</A>.
