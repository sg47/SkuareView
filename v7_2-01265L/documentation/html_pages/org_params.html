The 
<A HREF="org_params.html">org_params</A> parameter class records attributes which control aspects
of the code-stream organization (hence the name, "ORG").
None of these attributes are actually preserved in
code-stream marker segments, but they may be established
during compression in the same manner as any other
code-stream parameter attributes, most of which do
wind up in marker segments. Tile-specific forms of
the ORG parameters exist, but component-specific forms
do not.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "ORG", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORG_params">ORG_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 The following attributes are defined. For an explanation
of pattern strings, consult the comments appearing
with 
<A HREF="kdu_params__par$e_string__1.html">kdu_params::parse_string</A>.
</P><UL><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtparts">ORGtparts</A>; Pattern = "[R=1|L=2|C=4]" &mdash; Controls the division
of each tile's packets into tile-parts. The attribute
consists of one or more of the flags, 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtparts_R">ORGtparts_R</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtparts_L">ORGtparts_L</A> and 
<B>ORGtpargs_C</B>. If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtparts_R">ORGtparts_R</A> flag is supplied, tile-parts will be introduced as
necessary to ensure that each tile-part consists of
packets from only one resolution level. If 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtparts_L">ORGtparts_L</A> is supplied, tile-parts are introduced as necessary
to ensure that each tile-part consists of packets from
only one quality layer. Similarly, if 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtparts_C">ORGtparts_C</A> is supplied, each tile-part will consist of packets
from only one component. Note that the cost of extra
tile-part headers will not be taken into account during
rate control, so that the code-stream may end up being
a little larger than you expect. By default, tile-part
boundaries are introduced only as required by the presence
of multiple 
<A HREF="globals.html#Porder">Porder</A> attribute specifications (see 
<A HREF="poc_params.html">poc_params</A>).
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGgen_plt">ORGgen_plt</A>; Pattern = "B" &mdash; Requests the insertion of packet
length information in the header of all tile-parts
associated with tiles for which this attribute is true.
The PLT marker segments written into the relevant tile-part
headers will hold the lengths of those packets which
belong to the same tile-part. Note that the cost of
any PLT marker segments generated as a result of this
attribute being enabled will not be taken into account
during rate allocation. This means that the resulting
code-streams will generally be a little larger than
one might expect; however, this is probably a reasonable
policy, since the PLT marker segments may be removed
without losing any information. Also note that the
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGplt_parts">ORGplt_parts</A> attribute may be used to take control over the way
in which PLT information is partitioned into distinct
PLT marker segments.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGplt_parts">ORGplt_parts</A>; Pattern = "[R=1|L=2|C=4]" &mdash; Controls the division
of packet length information into PLT marker segments;
this attribute has no impact unless 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGgen_plt">ORGgen_plt</A> is true. The attribute consists of one or more of
the flags, 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGplt_parts_R">ORGplt_parts_R</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGplt_parts_L">ORGplt_parts_L</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGplt_parts_C">ORGplt_parts_C</A>. If the 
<B>R</B> flag is supplied, new PLT marker segments will be
started as required to ensure that no PLT marker segment
contains length information for packets that belong
to different resolution levels. Similarly, the 
<B>L</B> and 
<B>C</B> flags cause packet length information to be partitioned
into distinct PLT marker segments at quality layer
and codestream image component boundaries, respectively.
By default, packet length information is packed into
the smallest possible collection of PLT marker segments.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGgen_tlm">ORGgen_tlm</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Requests the insertion of TLM
(tile-part-length) marker segments in the main header,
to facilitate random access to the code-stream. This
attribute takes a single integer-valued parameter,
which identifies the maximum number of tile-parts which
will be written to the code-stream for each tile. The
reason for including this parameter is that space for
the TLM information must be reserved ahead of time;
once the entire code-stream has been written the generation
machinery goes back and overwrites this reserved space
with actual TLM data. If the actual number of tile-parts
which are generated is less than the value supplied
here, empty tile-parts will be inserted into the code-stream
so as to use up all of the reserved TLM space. For
this reason, you should try to estimate the maximum
number of tile-parts you will need as accurately as
possible, noting that the actual value may be hard
to determine ahead of time if incremental flushing
features are to be employed. An error will be generated
at run-time if the number of declared maximum number
of tile-parts turns out to be insufficient. You should
note that this attribute may be ignored if the 
<A HREF="kdu$arget.html">kdu_compressed_target</A> object, to which generated data is written, does not
support repositioning via 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__sta$t_rewrite.html">kdu_compressed_target::start_rewrite</A>.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style">ORGtlm_style</A>; Pattern="(implied=0,byte=1,short=2)(short=2,long=4)"
&mdash; Can be used to control the format used to record
TLM (tile-part-length) marker segments; it is relevant
only in conjunction with "ORGgen_tlm". The standard
defines 6 different formats for the TLM marker segment,
some of which are more compact than others. The main
reason for providing this level of control is that
some applications/profiles may expect a specific format
to be used. By default, each record in a TLM marker
segment is written with 6 bytes, 2 of which identify
the tile number, while the remaining 4 give the length
of the relevant tile-part. This attribute takes two
fields: the first field specifies the number of bytes
to be used to record tile numbers (0, 1 or 2); the
second field specifies the number of bytes to be used
to record tile-part lengths (2 or 4). The values provided
here might not be checked ahead of time, which means
that some combinations may be found to be illegal at
some point during the compression process. It is probably
better to use the macros 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style_implied">ORGtlm_style_implied</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style_byte">ORGtlm_style_byte</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style_short">ORGtlm_style_short</A> for the first parameter and 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style_short">ORGtlm_style_short</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style_long">ORGtlm_style_long</A> for the second parameter, rather than explicit integers.
The first field may be 0 (
<A HREF="globals.html#ORGtlm_style_implied">ORGtlm_style_implied</A>) only if tiles are written in order and have exactly
one tile-part each. This is usually the case if "ORGtparts"
is not used, but incremental flushing of tiles which
are generated in an unusual order may violate this
assumption &mdash; this sort of thing can happen if
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">kdu_codestream::change_appearance</A> is used to compress imagery which is presented in
a transposed or flipped order, for example.
