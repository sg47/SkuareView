Recycles the resources returned by 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A>. The 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__rel$se_chunks.html#check_abandoned">check_abandoned</A> argument is provided for the benefit of advanced server
applications which may decide to abandon some of the
data chunks which have not yet been transmitted to
a remote client. Abandonment means that the application
will not transmit these chunks or that it has transmitted
them, but is not certain whether or not they have been
or ever will be received correctly, and is not prepared
to wait to find out. The decision to abandon data chunks
may be made in response to a substantial change in
the remote user's window of interest, but this decision
is the responsibility of the server application, not
the present object.
</P><P>
 If a chunk has been abandoned (and 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__rel$se_chunks.html#check_abandoned">check_abandoned</A> is true), the function restores its cache model associated
with all data-bins which contributed to the abandoned
chunk, so as to reflect the state which they had prior
to the point at which the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A> function was called (unless they have already been
restored to an even more primitive state as a result
of discovering other abandoned chunks). This process
may leave the cache model in a state where the number
of cached bytes for some precinct does not correspond
to a whole number of packets. This is possible because
packets which are larger than the maximum chunk size
must be broken down into smaller messages, only some
of which may belong to abandoned chunks.
</P><P>
 In the event that a fatal error occurs, successful
cleanup of all resources does not necessitate that
outstanding buffers be released using this function.
The internal chunk server keeps track of all resources
which it has allocated and destroys them automatically
when 
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A> is destroyed. Note, however, that this means you should
clean up any objects which may access 
<A HREF="kds_chunk.html">kds_chunk</A> objects before destroying the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A> object.
