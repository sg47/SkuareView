Use this function to recover an interface to a specific
frame within the sequence of animated display frames
for a specific presentation track (a.k.a. presentation
thread). As with other functions that accept a presentation
track index, the 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> argument is either 0 or else a "global presentation
track" index in the range 1 to T, where T is the count
returned via 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__count_tracks.html">count_tracks</A>.
</P><P>
 It is important to understand the notion of track
compatibility. Presentation tracks thread their way
through the frames defined by the top-level Composition
box and then through each of the JPX containers (Compositing
Layer Extensions boxes) that offer compositing instructions.
The top-level Composition box and each JPX container
with compositing instructions represents a context
for each presentation track. The first (top-level)
context defines frames for 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>=0, but is considered a prefix for all global presentation
tracks; thus, frames from this first context are compatible
with any valid 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>. Each successive context C defines frames for global
presentation tracks with 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> values T=1 thorugh T=T_C, where T_C is the number
of distinct collections of compositing instructions
defined within the Compositing Layer Extensions box.
However, the frames defined for the last track T=T_C
in the context are considered also to belong to all
later presentation tracks.
</P><P>
 Although the number of distinct presentation tracks
is limited, and may be recovered using 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__count_tracks.html">count_tracks</A>, this function does not impose any upper bound on
the 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> values that can be supplied. This is consistent with
the idea that the last track defined in any given context
is compatible with all larger track indices.
</P><P>
 Important consequences of the above conventions are:
</P><UL><LI>
Frames defined by the top-level Composition box can
be returned for any value of 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> whatsoever.
</LI><LI>
Only those frames defined by the top-level Composition
box can be returned if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>=0.
</LI><LI>
All frames associated with the first global presentation
thread can be returned if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>=1.
</LI><LI>
All frames associated with the last global presentation
thread can be returned if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> is greater than or equal to the number of tracks returned
by 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__count_tracks.html">count_tracks</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 If 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#frame_idx">frame_idx</A> is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number
of frames that can be considered consistent with the
track identified by 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>, the function returns an empty interface. However,
in cases where the ultimate 
<A HREF="jp2$y_src.html">jp2_family_src</A> data source is fueled by a dynamic cache, it may happen
that the function can return a non-empty interface
for a frame whose existence cannot yet be confirmed,
so long as 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#must_exist">must_exist</A> is false. This can happen in only two circumstances:
</P><UL><LI>
It may happen if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>=0 and the number of top-level compositing layers in
the file cannot yet be ascertained &mdash; the top-level
Composition box's frames (track-0) are limited by what
can be constructed using only top-level compositing
layers and it may be that a frame returned by this
function uses a top-level compositing layer whose existence
cannot yet be confirmed or denied. This situation does
not occur if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> &gt; 0 since in that case a non-empty return requires
confirmation of the existence of global presentation
threads, which means that at least one Compositing
Layer Extensions box must have been found, and this
in turn means that all top-level compositing layers
must have already been found.
</LI><LI>
It may happen if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#frame_idx">frame_idx</A> refers to a composited frame that is formed from compositing
instructions within a final Compositing Layer Extensions
box that has an indefinite repetition factor, along
with an unspecified number of contributed frames. In
this case, the number of frames may depend on the number
of Contiguous Codestreams or Fragment Tables that are
encountered, and these may become available progressively
&mdash; perhaps even as content is generated dynamically
(e.g., from a camera). It can happen then that the
function returns a non-empty interface in response
to a request for such a frame (only if 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#must_exist">must_exist</A> is false, though), before the existence of the frame
can be confirmed.
</LI></UL><P>
 The reason for offering the possibility of returning
frames whose existence cannot yet be confirmed is that
the returned 
<A HREF="jpx_frame.html">jpx_frame</A> interface can be used to determine the compositing
layers upon which the frame's existence depends. An
application may choose to form a JPIP query for these
compositing layers, for example, so that their existence
(or lack thereof) can be discovered after the contents
of the dynamic cache have grown to accommodate the
JPIP server's response.
</P><P>
 This function is intended for use with composition
objects obtained via 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$position.html">jpx_source::access_composition</A>. In all other circumstances, an empty interface will
be returned.

See detailed notes above, regarding top-level and JPX
container contexts and track compatibility. In particular,
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>=0 is compatible only with frames defined by the top-level
Composition box, but those frames are also compatible
with any 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A>, while any non-zero 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#track_idx">track_idx</A> value is guaranteed to be compatible with some global

If true, this function returns an empty interface unless
it can confirm the existence of the requested frame.
In this case, the application may find it useful to
invoke 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__cou$ck_frames.html">count_track_frames</A> to determine how many frames are actually known to
exist and whether or not this knowledge might change
in the future.
</P><P>
 One way to provoke a JPIP server into sending sufficient
information for a frame's existence to become apparent
is to send a special "jpxf-context-range" request to
the server. However, such requests might not be understood
by all servers. Another, more primitive mechanism,
is to send "jpxl-context-range" requests for the relevant
compositing layers. This method requires that you know
what compositing layers would be used by the frame
if it did exist. To learn this information, you can
invoke this function with the 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#must_exist">must_exist</A> argument set to false.
</P><P>
 You should be aware, however, that this function may
return an empty interface even if the frame does potentially
exist and 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html#must_exist">must_exist</A> is false, if the function is unable to read sufficient
information from a dynamic cache to discover the frame's
compositing instructions. To ensure that such a situation
does not persist indefinitely, it is a good idea to
augment JPIP requests with a metadata request for all
boxes with the box-type 
<A HREF="globals.html#jp2_comp_instruction_set_4cc">jp2_comp_instruction_set_4cc</A>. This can be done using the convenient 
<A HREF="jpx_source__gen$_metareq.html">jpx_source::generate_metareq</A> function.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="include_persistents">include_persistents</A> [<B>bool</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
In most cases, you should leave this argument equal
to its default value (true). In this case, the returned
<A HREF="jpx_frame.html">jpx_frame</A> interface is configured to automatically fold all
previous frames that are marked as persistent into
the set of instructions returned by 
<A HREF="jpx_frame__get$struction.html">jpx_frame::get_instruction</A> and enumerated by 
<A HREF="jpx_frame__get_info.html">jpx_frame::get_info</A>. The only reason for setting this argument to false
is if intend to buffer up the composited results produced
by persistent frames and reuse them in the future.
The 
<A HREF="jpx_frame__is_$ersistent.html">jpx_frame::is_persistent</A> function can be used to determine whether or not a
frame is persistent (and hence might need to be buffered
up in such an application).
