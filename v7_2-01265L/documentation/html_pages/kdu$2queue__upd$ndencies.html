The base implementation of this function provides an
automatic mechanism for passing information about potentially
blocking dependencies between a queue and its parent,
allowing applications to check whether or not a potentially
blocking dependency exists within any sub-tree of the
queue hierarchy. More sophisticated processing engines
may derive from 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>, overriding this function and using the derived information
to schedule jobs in such a way that the scheduled jobs
should be free from dependencies. This certainly happens
within the implementation of 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>, but the approach may be extended to any application-defined
class that wants to participate in an efficient multi-threaded
system.
</P><P>
 The function's two arguments are normally interpreted
as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> is interpreted as a change in the number of potentially
blocking dependencies represented by objects that invoke
this function. Typically, each such object is either
in a potentially blocking state or not; if so, the
next attempt to "use" some service offered by the object
might block the caller; otherwise, the next attempt
to use the service will not block the caller. With
this in mind, we would normally expect 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> to take values of 0, 1 or -1, where 1 means that there
is one more object that might block progress of machinery
that relies on the services of all objects that call
into this function, while -1 means that there is one
less object that might block such progress.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> is interpreted as a change in the maximum number of
possible dependencies. This means that the sum of all
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> values passed to this function should not exceed the
sum of all 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> values supplied to the function. However, if calls
to this function arrive from different threads, it
is possible that this condition is temporarily violated.
For an implementation to determine that there are no
future potential blocking dependencies, it should wait
for the condition in which the cumulative sum of all
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> values passed to this function AND the cumulative
sum of all 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> values supplied to this function to both become 0.
One way to determine this in a robust way is to keep
a single interlocked variable that stores both sums.
</LI><LI>
Objects that invoke this function should pass a positive
value for 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> in their first call to this function (unless they
will never call the function), identifying the maximum
value of the cumulative sum of all 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> values they will pass to the function in the future.
Negative values for 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> should then be passed only in their final call to
this function, so that the sum of supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> values returns to 0. Typically, each object that presents
a service with possibly blocking dependencies passes
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A>=1 in its first call to this function and 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A>=-1 in its last call to this function, because, as
mentioned above, the cumulative sum of 
<B>new_depenencies</B> values supplied by each such object is always either
1 or 0.
</LI><LI>
Some derived thread queue implementations will use
only the 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> values, ignoring the values passed via 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 The base implementation maintains two internal counters,
D and M, that are initialized to 0 and implements a
fan-out interpretation of dependencies in order to
propagate them to any parent queue or dependency monitor.
Specifically, each call to this function atomically
adds 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> to D and 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> to M. Following the policy described above, one would
expect 0 &lt;= D &lt;= M to hold at all times. However,
in some cases different threads might be used to signal
increments and decrements to the number of dependencies
(this is exactly what happens in the implementation
of 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> objects), so the calls to increase and to decrease
the number of dependencies might experience different
delays and arrive out of order, leading to the possibility
that instantaneous values of D could be &lt; 0 and
instantaneous values of M could potentially be smaller
than D. However, it should never happen that M becomes
negative, so long as all calls that supply positive
values of 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> arrive during object creation, before anything happens
that could generate calls with negative values from
any thread. The base implementation propagates dependency
information to any parent queue (or installed 
<A HREF="kdu$nitor.html">kdu_thread_dependency_monitor</A>) as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
If the value of D transitions from &lt;= 0 to &gt;
0, the overall system represented by this queue and
its service objects is considered to present a potentially
blocking dependency to its parent, so the parent queue's
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> function is invoked with a 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> argument of 1. Conversely, if D transitions from &gt;
0 to &lt;= 0, the parent queue's 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> function is invoked with a 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> argument of -1.
</LI><LI>
If the value of M transitions from &lt;= 0 to &gt;
0, the overall system represented by this queue and
its service objects is considered to be able to present
blocking dependencies, so any parent queue's 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> function is invoked with a 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> argument of 1 &mdash; as noted above, this typically
happens during object creation/startup. Conversely,
if the value of M transitions from &gt; 0 to &lt;=
0, the overall system represented by this queue and
its service objects is considered to be unable to present
any further blocking dependencies, so any parent queue's
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> function is invoked with a 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> argument of -1. As stated above, we do not expect
M ever to become -ve, but it is possible that M becomes
zero before D becomes 0, if a call that notionally
decrements D before the one decrementing M is substantially
delayed. The base implementation itself does not ever
compare M with D.
</LI></UL><P>
 To put the above discussion into context, we now give
some examples of "potentially blocking dependencies".
</P><UL><LI>
A 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> object which does not currently have any buffered
rows of decoded subband samples represents a potentially
blocking dependency for any processing agent that might
need to invoke 
<B>kdu_decoder::pull</B>. Any attempt to pull synthesized image samples from
a 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A> object that involves this 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> amongst its dependencies may potentially block, depending
on whether or not the 
<B>kdu_synthesis::pull</B> call required new data from that subband.
</LI><LI>
Similarly, a 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> object whose subband sample buffer is currently full
(waiting for encoding) represents a potentially blocking
dependency for any processing agent that might need
to invoke 
<B>kdu_encoder::push</B>. This kind of dependency might block a 
<B>kdu_analysis::push</B> call if the wavelet transform operation generates
new data for that subband.
</LI><LI>
A 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object presents a potentially blocking dependency
to other objects that use it, if the availability of
data for any image component is questionable &mdash;
this happens if that image component's DWT synthesis
tree involves potentially blocking dependencies and
there are no buffered image lines available for the
component. A 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object that identifies itself as unblocked has the
property that at least one line can be pulled from
each active image component without risk of blocking
the caller. Applications might create larger queues
to manage the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> dependencies associated with a whole row of tile processing
engines, each represented by a 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object.
</LI><LI>
Similarly, a 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> object is considered unblocked if at least one line
can be pushed into each active image component without
blocking the caller; otherwise, it will present itself
as having potentially blocking dependencies.
</LI></UL><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> is overridden in a derived class, alternate interpretations
may be ascribed to the 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#new_dependencies">new_dependencies</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html#delta_max_dependencies">delta_max_dependencies</A> arguments for custom applications, so long as these
are understood by other queues that might invoke the
object's 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> function while doing work. The 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> object maintains an internal queue for block decoding
operations whose 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">update_dependencies</A> function may be invoked by asynchronous code-block
parsing operations with a custom interpretation for
the set of code-blocks for which compressed data has
been parsed by the machinery embodied via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface.
</P><P>
 You should remember that this function is generally
invoked asynchronously &mdash; potentially from any
thread. Therefore, if you do choose to override the
function, it is your responsibility to synchronize
access to any state information that threads might
otherwise access concurrently.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that objects which use this function
to avoid scheduling jobs until there are no dependencies
present a major risk of deadlock to the overall multi-threaded
system. This is pretty much an unavoidable price to
pay for the efficiency that arises from scheduling
work only when the dependencies are sorted out. The
implementation and invocation of this function must
be undertaken with the greatest of care. Kakadu's core
system provides a number of highly efficient data processing
entities that override this function so as to schedule
work that should not block. These data processing entities,
such as 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> actually use interlocked atomic variables for synchronization,
as opposed to a simpler, more conventional critical
section approach based on mutexes. It is recommended
that a first implementation of any queue-derived processing
entity that schedules work based on a dependency analysis
should use critical sections initially, to be quite
sure of avoiding race conditions that could lead to
a scheduling deadlock. It is also recommended that
all objects that present potentially blocking services
implement a method based on 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__sig$condition.html">kdu_thread_entity::signal_condition</A> to ensure that appropriate blocking will actually
occur if dependencies are not satisfied when a "parent"
object attempts to use these services.

<P>
The function should return false only if it is known
that dependency information is not of interest. This
in turn is used to determine a correct return value
for the 
<B>propagate_dependencies</B> function. The base implementation uses the return
values to determine, on the very first call, whether
dependency information is being used. If not, the base
implementation of this function recognizes that there
is no further need to keep track of or propagate dependency
information, which saves potentially time consuming
manipulation of the synchronized state variables.
