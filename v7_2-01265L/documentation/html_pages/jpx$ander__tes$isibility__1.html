<P>
This powerful function provides a method for determining
the visibility of a codestream (usually for a particular
region of interest defined on the codestream) in the
overall composition associated with the supplied 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#frame">frame</A>. Codestreams are assigned to frames through their
compositing layers, so the function returns the index
of the compositing layer associated with any match
(-1 if there is none).
</P><P>
 In most applications it is helpful to limit codestream
matches to those which are used by one or more known
compositing layers. One way to supply a set of candidate
compositing layers is by using the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#layer_indices">layer_indices</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#num_layers">num_layers</A> arguments. Another complementary approach is to provide
a number list metanode via the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#numlist">numlist</A> argument, in which case compositing layer indices
that are candidates are those for which 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__tes$ist_layer.html">numlist.test_numlist_layer</A> returns true. This second method is more powerful,
because the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__tes$ist_layer.html">numlist.test_numlist_layer</A> function takes account of the compositing layer replication
that may occur if the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#numlist">numlist</A> metanode is embedded in a JPX container. Both methods
can actually be used together, in which case candidate
compositing layers must pass the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__tes$ist_layer.html">numlist.test_numlist_layer</A> test and also be found within the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#layer_indices">layer_indices</A> array.
</P><P>
 In cases where a compositing layer cannot yet be accessed
(when the ultimate source of data is a dynamic cache
with incomplete information), the function assumes
that it might potentially use the indicated codestream
&mdash; this is important for interactive applications
involving JPIP. This can lead to a lot of false matches
if compositing layer restrictions are known to the
caller but not provided here.
</P><P>
 One of the main applications for this function is
determining whether a region-of-interest defined at
the file-format level, for one or more codestreams,
is visible in a frame, so that the next visible frame
can be located and displayed when the region of interest
is selected from a menu by an interactive user.
</P><P>
 The first two arguments have exactly the same interpretation
as their namesakes in the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__construct__1.html">construct</A> function. Unlike that function, however, the present
function does not actually manipulate the internal
structure of any object &mdash; in fact this is a static
function.
</P><P>
 Since a given codestream might appear multiple times
in the construction of a frame, the function provides
you with the option to walk through each matching layer
in which the codestream (or an identified region of
it) might be visible in the composition. This is done
via the optional 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#initial_matches_to_skip">initial_matches_to_skip</A> argument. The caller may use this argument to figure
out the layer in which the codestream (or its region
of interest) is most visible. In most cases, however,
the first match is likely to be the most visible one,
since the function works backwards from the top-most
compositing layers to the bottom-most, the latter being
more likely to be covered.
</P><P>
 The function is only able to provide a conservative
estimate of visibility, based upon intersecting the
original region of interest with any opaque covering
layers. In particular, whenever an opaque layer covers
the layer which contains this codestream's region of
interest, the function estimates the visible portion
of the region to be the largest rectangular subset
of the original region, such that none of its rows
and columns are completely covered. Where multiple
layers cover the region in complicated ways, this function
may estimate the region to be visible even though it
has been completely hidden. However, this is very unlikely.
</P><P>
 As discussed for the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__construct__1.html">construct</A> function, it may not be possible to determine whether
or not a compositing layer (or region thereof) is covered
by another opaque layer if the potentially covering
layer is not yet accessible (i.e, if 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html">jpx_source::access_layer</A> returns an empty interface, when called with a false
value for its 
<B>need_stream_headers</B> argument). In such cases, the function errs on the
side of assuming that the compositing layer or region
in question is visible. In fact, if a layer is not
accessible, we cannot even determine which codestreams
it uses, so the function assumes that the codestream
in question belongs to that layer unless the layer
is excluded by failure to match any of the entries
in a supplied 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#layer_indices">layer_indices</A> array or failure to pass the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__tes$ist_layer.html">numlist.test_numlist_layer</A> test. In all of these cases, if more data arrives
in a dynamic cache, it is possible that a subsequent
call to this function will return false when provided
with the same arguments.

Ignored if an empty interface. Also ignored if 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$list_info.html">numlist.get_numlist_info</A> returns false or indicates that the number list is
not associated with any compositing layers at all.
Otherwise, this argument provides constraints on the
compositing layers that can be returned by the function.
In particular, the function will not consider any compositing
layer that does not pass the test associated with 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__tes$ist_layer.html">numlist.test_numlist_layer</A> to be a visibility match, regardless of whether or
not the layer uses the codestream identified by 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#codestream_idx">codestream_idx</A>.
</P><P>
 This is useful in reducing the workload associated
with locating a region of interest that is known to
be associated with specific compositing layers. The
information is particularly beneficial when working
with a dynamic cache whose contents may not yet have
grown to the point where compositing layers can be
accessed. In particular, if an inaccessible compositing
layer cannot be excluded on the basis of the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#numlist">numlist</A> array, it must be considered to use the codestream
in question, at least for the time being.

If non-NULL, this argument also provides constraints
on the compositing layers that can be returned by the
function. In particular, the function will not consider
any compositing layer whose index is not found in this

or not the layer uses the codestream identified by

On entry, if this region is non-empty, it identifies
a region on the composited frame, in which the visibility
of the codestream (or its region) is of interest. This
may, for example, be a viewport being used by an interactive
viewer. If empty, the region is considered to be that
of the entire composited frame.
</P><P>
 On exit, the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#composition_region">composition_region</A> object is set to contain the region of the codestream

system of the composited image.
</P><P>
 Note, however, that if the ultimate source of data
is a dynamic cache and the function has been unable
to access the compositing layer whose index is returned
here, its association with the codestream is only assumed,
so that the region returned via this argument might
not be particularly meaningful.

If this region is non-empty, it identifies a region
of interest whose visibility we are testing, expressed
with respect to the high resolution reference grid
of the codestream in question, except that the location
of the region is expressed relative to the origin of
the image on the codestream, which might not always
be the same as the origin of the high resolution reference
grid itself (this is the same convention used by ROI
description boxes in the JPX file format &mdash; no
accident). If the region is empty, the region of interest
is considered to be the entire codestream.

If true, the function ignores codestreams which are
used only for generating opacity data for a compositing
layer. This is usually a good idea, since the file
format only allows regions of interest to be specified
on a per-codestream basis. If the codestream contains
some components which are used only for alpha blending
channels and those components are used in some compositing
layers which do not employ the actual imagery, it is
unlikely that we will be interested in the region of
interest within such layers.

If zero, the function returns the first compositing

<A HREF="jpx$ander__tes$isibility__1.html#composition_region">composition_region</A>). If this argument is set to 1, the function returns
the second compositing layer in which the visibility
conditions are found to hold; and so forth.
