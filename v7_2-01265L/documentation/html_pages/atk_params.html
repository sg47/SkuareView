Manages the information associated with JPEG2000 Part-2
<B>ATK</B> marker segments. Tile-specific forms are allowed and
multiple instances are treated like components for
the purpose of inheritance (see the 
<B>treat_instances_like_components</B> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A> constructor).
</P><P>
 The purpose of this parameter class is to describe
a wavelet transform kernel. The instance number of
the 
<A HREF="atk_params.html">atk_params</A> object is referenced by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Catk">Catk</A> attribute, if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels">Ckernels</A> holds the value 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels_ATK">Ckernels_ATK</A>. These instance numbers must be in the range 2 through
255.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "ATK", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#ATK_params">ATK_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 The following attributes are defined. For an explanation
of pattern strings, consult the comments appearing
with 
<A HREF="kdu_params__par$e_string__1.html">kdu_params::parse_string</A>.
</P><UL><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kreversible">Kreversible</A>; Pattern = "B" &mdash; This attribute determines how
the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksteps">Ksteps</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kcoeffs">Kcoeffs</A> attributes should be treated. A default value cannot
be created automatically, so you must explicitly specify
a value if you want ATK information to become available
for any particular instance index in the main header
or a tile header. In the end, this parameter attribute
must agree with the value of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creversible">Creversible</A> attribute, for any tile-component which uses this
transformation kernel. In practice, this consistency
can only be ensured once 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> has been called, which means that the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__fin$lize_all__1.html">kdu_params::finalize_all</A> function must be called both during the writing and
during the reading of codestream parameters.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksymmetric">Ksymmetric</A>; Pattern = "B" &mdash; If true, the transform kernel
belongs to the whole-sample symmetric class, which
is treated specially by JPEG2000 Part-2. The translated
impulse responses of these kernels are all symmetric
about 0 &mdash; see the Taubman & Marcellin book, Chapter
6, for a definition of translated impulse responses.
Equivalently, all lifting steps involve even-length
symmetric lifting coefficients, Cs[n], where the coefficients
associated with steps s=0, 2, 4, ... are symmetric
about n = 1/2 and the coefficients associated with
steps s=1, 3, 5, ... are symmetric about n = -1/2.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kextension">Kextension</A>; Pattern = "(CON=0,SYM=1)" &mdash; Identifies the
boundary extension method to be applied in each lifting
step. If 
<B>CON</B>, boundary samples are simply replicated. The other
possible value, 
<B>SYM</B>, means that boundary samples are symmetrically extended.
The centre of symmetry in this case is the boundary
sample location within an interleaved representation
in which low-pass samples occupy the even indexed locations
and high-pass samples occupy the odd indexed locations.
The 
<B>SYM</B> method must be used if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksymmetric">Ksymmetric</A> is true. Conversely, for non-symmetric filters you
are strongly recommded to use the 
<B>CON</B> method, since this method can use less memory and
other methods can make region-of-interest calculations
very difficult for small regions which are close to
the image boundaries. When setting the profile, you
may find it convenient to use the macro's 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kextension_CON">Kextension_CON</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kextension_SYM">Kextension_SYM</A>.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksteps">Ksteps</A>; Pattern = "IIII", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; Array with
one entry for each lifting step. The first entry corrsponds
to lifting step s=0, which updates odd indexed samples,
based on even indexed samples; the second entry corresponds
to lifting step s=1, which updates even indexed samples,
based on odd indexed samples; and so forth. The first
field in each record holds the length, Ls, of the coefficient
array Cs[n], for the relevant step s. The second field
is the location of the first entry, Ns, where Cs[n]
is defined for n=Ns to Ns+Ls-1. The value of Ns is
typically negative, but need not be. For symmetric
kernels, Ls must be even and Ns must satisfy Ns=-floor((Ls+p-1)/2),
where p is the lifting step parity (0 if s is even,
1 if s is odd). The third and fourth fields must both
be 0 if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kreversible">Kreversible</A> is false. For reversible transform kernels, however,
the third field holds the downshift value, Ds, while
the fourth field holds the rounding offset, Rs, to
be added immediately prior to downshifting.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kcoeffs">Kcoeffs</A>; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; Holds the lifting
coefficients, Cs[n]. The first L0 records describe
the coefficients of the first lifting step. These are
followed by the L1 coefficients of the second lifting
step, and so forth. The Ls values are identified by
the first field in each 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksteps">Ksteps</A> record. Lifting step s may be described by X_s[2k+1-p]
+= TRUNC(sum_{Ns&lt;=n&lt;Ns+Ls} Cs[n]*X_{s-1}[2k+p+2n]).
In the case of an irreversible transform, the TRUNC
operator does nothing and all arithmetic is performed
(at least notionally) in floating point. For reversible
transforms, TRUNC(a) = floor(a + Rs*2^{-Ds}) and Cs[n]
is guaranteed to be an integer multiple of 2^{-Ds}.
