All processing in Kakadu's multi-threading environments
is ultimately associated with thread queues. Unlike
previous versions of Kakadu, the 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> is no longer an opaque internal object; instead, major
processing entities in your system may be based on
objects that you derive from 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>. For this reason, you supply the (optionally) derived
object to this function as its 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#queue">queue</A> argument. It is, however, possible to use the base
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> object as it stands without any derivation. It is
also possible to request a special internally allocated
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> object by using the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> function &mdash; provided mainly for backward compatibility
with previous versions of Kakadu.
</P><P>
 Conceptually, processing jobs are scheduled by invoking
<B>kdu_thread_queue::schedule_jobs</B> and threads in the relevant domain are used to perform
these jobs, wherever possible. However, the internal
implementation need not (and currently does not) look
like this at all. Jobs added via the queue's 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::schedule_jobs</B> function are directly added to a single domain-specific
job pool and performed both by threads that are associated
with the domain (first choice) or by any other threads.
The term "queue" is still used, suggesting that each
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> might have its own separate queue of jobs in some
implementations. However, the threading environment
no longer provides any guaranteed way of waiting for
such hypothetical job queues to empty; at the level
of the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> object, it is possible only to wait until a thread
queue identifies itself as completely "finished" via
its 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::all_done</B> function. One waits for this to happen using the important
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> function. It is also possible to encourage a queue
(or sub-tree of related queues) to finish early by
calling the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> function, which is closely related to (actually implemented
on top of) the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> function. See the descriptions of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> for more information on how these things work.
</P><P>
 Once a 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#queue">queue</A> has been added using this function, it remains associated
with the thread group until it is removed by a call
to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> (possibly as part of a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>), even though the queue might meanwhile identify itself
as being "finished". Moreover, so long as a queue remains
associated with the thread group, you can add other
queues to it as descendants, by passing it as the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#super_queue">super_queue</A> argument to this function. The role of super queues
is primarily to provide a simple means for applications
to wait for completion of a collection of related queues,
via calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>.
</P><P>
 A typical way to use super-queues in the Kakadu environment
is as follows: 1) each tile processor may be associated
with a single top-level queue; 2) each tile-component
processor may be associated with a sub-queue of the
corresponding tile queue; 3) each subband may be associated
with a sub-queue of the corresponding tile-component
queue; and 4) each codestream may be associated with
a special internal queue that handles background reading,
writing or speculative memory management for the codestream
data itself.
</P><P>
 As with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A>, this function has a 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#domain_name">domain_name</A> argument that may cause the creation of a new domain
(initially without any associated threads) if it is
found to be unique. Domains survive until the thread
group is destroyed, so you should not be supplying
an endless string of new domain names here.
</P><P>
 Unlike 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A>, this function must be supplied with a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#domain_name">domain_name</A> argument that does not refer to an empty string, except
in the special case of queues that do not schedule
jobs. That is, if a queue does schedule jobs, meaning
that its 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__get$max_jobs.html">kdu_thread_queue::get_max_jobs</A> function returns a non-zero value, the queue may not
be added to a thread group's "default domain". This
ensures that threads within the default domain (of
which the group owner is always one) are always equally
prepared to do work within any domain.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that any thread may create queues,
not just the group owner thread. It follows that any
thread may create new domains.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#queue_flags">queue_flags</A> argument allows queues to be assigned specific attributes
as they are attached. You should be aware that the
attributes supplied here are added to the thread domain
associated with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#domain_name">domain_name</A>, even if it already exists, and affect the way in
which all of its jobs are processed. For this reason,
the thread queue attributes should really be understood
as attributes for all the jobs that are scheduled via
thread queues associated with the domain. Currently,
only two attribute flags are defined, as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> &mdash; if this flag is present, jobs scheduled to
the thread domain may not be launched by any thread
that is currently in an unsafe "working wait" state.
Threads enter a working wait state by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> &mdash; they remain in this state until the condition
they are waiting for occurs, and during this time their
resources may be used to execute other jobs that have
been scheduled. This is generally beneficial, because
it minimizes the likelihood that a thread becomes idle.
However, it is possible for deadlocks to occur in some
circumstances. For example, consider a job that enters
a working wait by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> to wait for a condition (A); suppose this thread executes
another job while waiting and this job attempts to
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> upon the completion of a thread queue that cannot
finish until the first job passes condition A. This
leaves the thread waiting upon itself indefinitely.
Considering this, where an application schedules its
own custom jobs, it is usually safest to do so through
a queue with the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> attribute. In this case, the queues jobs can be executed
by a thread that is not in a working wait, or by the
main "group owner" thread for the multi-threaded environment,
if 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__dec$wait_safe.html">declare_first_owner_wait_safe</A> has been called and the group owner thread has not
recursively entered the working wait state. For more
on this last condition, refer to the documentation
accompanying the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__dec$wait_safe.html">declare_first_owner_wait_safe</A> function. If your custom jobs never invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A>, either directly or indirectly, there is no need to
schedule them with the safe context restriction.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_BACKGROUND">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_BACKGROUND</A> &mdash; As mentioned in the introductory notes to
the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> object, jobs scheduled within a background thread
domain (i.e., jobs with this attribute) might experience
long delays and are often scheduled well ahead of the
point at which they are needed. For this reason, background
jobs are not performed within a "working wait" (i.e.,
not performed by a thread that is inside 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>) unless all threads in the entire thread group are
in the working wait state.
</LI></UL><P>
 Evidently, the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_BACKGROUND">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_BACKGROUND</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> attributes have very similar implications. The main
difference is that background jobs can potentially
be executed within a working wait if there are no other
options, whereas safe-context jobs cannot. In fact,
safe-context jobs make no sense unless the thread group
has at least two threads (at least one worker thread,
in addition to the group owner), whereas background
jobs can still make sense even if there is actually
only one thread.
</P><P>
 Both background and safe-context thread queues are
also treated slightly differently with respect to calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>. Specifically, these calls always wait for completion
of regular queues before waiting for the completion
of background or safe-context queues with the same
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#super_queue">super_queue</A> parent. Similarly, top-level background/safe-context
queues are joined after top-level regular queues.
</P><P>
 The role of the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#min_sequencing_idx">min_sequencing_idx</A> argument is perhaps the most mysterious. Associated
with each queue is a sequencing index that is the larger
of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#min_sequencing_idx">min_sequencing_idx</A> and the sequencing index of any 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#super_queue">super_queue</A> to which it is added as a descendant. When 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::schedule_jobs</B> is used to schedule new jobs, they are assigned the
queue's sequencing index. The system attempts to launch
jobs in such a way that those with smaller sequencing
indices all run before those with larger sequencing
indices; moreover, it tries to do this across all jobs
in all domains. Of course, this might not be possible
if all jobs with sequencing index N have been launched
and then, some time later, new jobs are scheduled that
have a sequencing index smaller than N.
</P><P>
 Distinct sequencing indices can actually consume significant
resources internally, so you are advised to use them
sparingly, advancing the index by 1 between tiles or
sets of tiles you wish to have processed before other
ones, or between codestreams you wish to have processed
in order. The main reason for introducing sequencing
indices at all is to allow you to create queues and
commence processing on a new data set (e.g., tiles
of a codestream or codestreams within a larger set)
while some asynchronous work completes on an older
data set &mdash; this way, you can avoid having some
threads go idle as work comes to a close on the old
data set.
</P><P>
 You should note that the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html#min_sequencing_idx">min_sequencing_idx</A> passed to the present function is generally expected
to be non-decreasing. In fact, you would do best to
start with a sequence index of 0 and increment the
index by 1 each time the need arises. If you have already
added a queue with one sequencing index, you should
not later add one with a smaller sequencing index.
If you do, the index will be increased automatically
to ensure monotonicity. Nevertheless, the function
does attempt to remove wrap-around effects by judging
sequence index S1 to be smaller than sequence index
S2 only if (kdu_long)(S2-S1) is positive. In this way,
it should be possible to increment sequence indices
indefinitely without violating the ordering convention.
</P><P>
 This function may throw an exception if something
has failed inside the thread group (probably another
thread has thrown an exception and passed through 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A>).
