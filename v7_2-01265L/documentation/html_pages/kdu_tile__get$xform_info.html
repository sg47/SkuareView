<P>
Use this function, after first discovering the structure
of a multi-component transform block, using 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$block_info.html">get_mct_block_info</A>, to determine whether the transform block is implemented
using a reversible decorrelation transform. Reversible
decorrelation transforms are implemented very differently
from irreversible matrix decorrelation transforms (see
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$atrix_info.html">get_mct_matrix_info</A>). If this function returns false, you should try 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$atrix_info.html">get_mct_matrix_info</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$dency_info.html">get_mct_dependency_info</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$t_dwt_info.html">get_mct_dwt_info</A> to determine if the block is implemented using an
irreversible matrix decorrelation transform, a dependency
transform or a discrete wavelet transform. If all four
functions return zero (false or NULL), the block is
implemented using a "null transform" &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$block_info.html">get_mct_block_info</A> for a discussion of null transforms.
</P><P>
 Any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$xform_info.html#coefficients">coefficients</A> array must have M by (M+1) entries, where M is the
value of 
<B>num_block_inputs</B> returned by 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$block_info.html">get_mct_block_info</A>. A non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$xform_info.html#coefficients">coefficients</A> array is used to return an M by (M+1) matrix, in row-major
order. The (M+1) columns of this matrix represent a
succession of reversible "lifting" steps. During the
inverse multicomponent transform (the one used during
decompression), the first column serves to adjust the
last input component, based on a rounded linear combination
of the others. The second column serves to adjust the
second-last input component, based on a rounded linear
combination of the others, and so forth. The final
(extra) column again adjusts the last component, based
on a rounded linear combination of the first M-1 components,
but it also introduces a possible sign change.
</P><P>
 A more precise description of the reversible decorrelation
transform is as follows (remember that this description
is for the inverse transform, used during decompression).
Note that all coefficients and input samples are integers.
For each column c=0 to c=M-1, update component c'=M-1-c
as follows
</P><UL><LI>
Form the weighted linear combination, Uc', of all input
components j != c', using weights Tjc (row j, column
c of the 
<B>rev_coefficients</B> matrix).
</LI><LI>
Divide the result by Tc'c, rounding to the nearest
integer. Specifically, form floor((Uc'+(Tc'c/2))/Tc'c).
Here, Tc'c is guaranteed to be a positive power of
2.
</LI><LI>
Subtract the result from input component c' and use
the modified value for subsequent steps.
</LI></UL><P>
 The final step (column c=M) is similar to the first,
modifying component c'=M-1, based on a weighted combination
of components 0 through M-1 using coefficients TjM,
followed by rounded division. In this case, however,
the rounded division step is performed using |Tc'M|
and the adjusted final component samples are sign reversed
if Tc'M is negative. Here, |Tc'M| is guaranteed to
be a positive power of 2.
</P><P>
 In their original form, reversible transform blocks
always have an identical number of input and output
components, so that M is also the number of output
components produced by the block. However, Kakadu's
codestream management machinery conceals the presence
of output components which are not used by subsequent
stages. This depends also on the set of output components
which are of interest to the application, as configured
by calls to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> function. The application can typically remain oblivious
to such changes, except in a few circumstances, where
intermediate results must be computed over a larger
set of original components. In the present case, the
reversible transform must first be applied to all the
input components. Once this has been done, the transformed
input components are mapped to output components according
to the information returned via the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$xform_info.html#active_outputs">active_outputs</A> array. Specifically, the output component with index
n should be taken from the transformed input component
whose index is 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$xform_info.html#active_outputs">active_outputs</A>[n], for each n in the range 0 to 
<B>num_block_outputs</B>, where 
<B>num_block_outputs</B> is the value returned via 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$block_info.html">get_mct_block_info</A>.
</P><P>
 If this function returns true then you should use
the 
<B>rev_block_offsets</B> argument of the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$block_info.html">get_mct_block_info</A> function to determine any offsets to be applied to
the transform outputs.

You would typically call the function first with this
argument set to NULL. Then, once you know that a reversible
decorrelation transform is being used, you would allocate
an array of the correct size and pass it to the function
in a second call, so as to receive the transform coefficients.
Note carefully that the array represents a matrix with
M by (M+1) entries where M is the number of block inputs
(not necessarily equal to the number of block outputs).

set (and order) of outputs is guaranteed to be identical
to the set of inputs &mdash; this is the way reversible
transform blocks are defined by the underlying JPEG2000
standard, in the absence of any restrictions on the
set of components which are of interest to the application.
