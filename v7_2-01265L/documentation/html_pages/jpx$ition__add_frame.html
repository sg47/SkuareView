Use this function to add a frame, specifying the number
of milliseconds (
<A HREF="jpx$ition__add_frame.html#duration">duration</A>) until the next frame (if any) is to be started. You
must call this function at least once to cause a composition
box to be written into the JPX file being generated
by the 
<A HREF="jpx_target.html">jpx_target</A> object which supplied the present interface.
</P><P>
 Each frame can be repeated to create simple animations
or movies. To make more sophisticated animations, you
may need to explicitly add multiple frames. Where a
frame is repeated, the layer indices associated with
the compositing layers within each frame may either
remain fixed, or be advanced in a regular fashion.
For more on this, see 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__add$struction.html">add_instruction</A>.
</P><P>
 You must add at least one instruction to each new
frame which you create.
</P><P>
 You should be aware of the special significance associated
with a 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__add_frame.html#duration">duration</A> of 0. Frames with zero duration are to be treated
as "pause" frames by players. They are actually recorded
in the JPX composition box by setting the 
<B>LIFE</B> parameter of the final JPX composition instruction
in the frame to 0x7FFFFFFF, which is described in the
standard (IS15444-2) as an instruction for a player
to pause the animation and wait for user input. Kakadu's
demo applications and the 
<B>kdu_region_animator</B> object take the perspective that a playing animation
should stop at a pause frame, but when a user re-enters
the "play" mode, playback should commence from the
first successive non-pause frame. This also means that
an animation which commences with one or more pause
frames will skip over those frames when the "play"
mode is first entered, but show them if the user steps
through frames manually. This behaviour is consistent
with the standard and can be usefully exploited by
content creators.

Time between this frame and the next, measured in milliseconds.
If the frame is repeated, this is the time between
the repetitions and the time between the last repetition
and any frame which follows.
</P><P>
 Note that the special value of 0 is used to represent
frames whose final JPX animation instruction is assigned
a 
<B>LIFE</B> parameter equal to 0x7FFFFFFF. As explained above,
these are to be interpreted as pause frames.

If 0, the frame is not repeated. Otherwise, this is
the number of times the frame is to be repeated. A
negative value means that the frame should be repeated
indefinitely. This only makes sense for the last frame
to be added.

<H4><A NAME="is_persistent">is_persistent</A> [<B>bool</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
If true, the compositing instructions in this frame
contribute to a background composition which is to
be used by all subsequent frames. Otherwise, the instructions
in this frame contribute only to the rendering of the
frame itself.
</P><P>
 Although persistent frames sound like a good idea,
you should try to avoid them. One reason for this is
that they make it difficult for a player to start from
an arbitrary frame in the sequence. Another more insidious
reason is that persistent frames make it difficult
to implement quality progressive compositions or dynamic
rendering of regions of interest within a large composed
image which cannot be fully stored in a buffer. The
<A HREF="kdu$sitor.html">kdu_region_compositor</A> object goes to a lot of effort to figure out which
persistent frames can be ignored in such a rendering
process, but it is far better as a content creator
to simply avoid the use of persistent frames, or to
use only a single persistent background frame.
