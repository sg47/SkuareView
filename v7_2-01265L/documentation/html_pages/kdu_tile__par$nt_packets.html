<DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This function may be used to parse all compressed data
packets which belong to the tile. The packets which
are required to be parsed generally depend upon resolution,
component, quality layer and region of interest restrictions
which may have been applied via a previous call to
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>.
</P><P>
 Normally, packets are parsed from the codestream on
demand, in response to calls to the 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__open_block.html">kdu_subband::open_block</A> function. However, this function can be used to bring
the relevant compressed data into memory ahead of time.
One reason you may wish to do this is to discover the
amount of compressed data in each quality layer of
the relevant tile-component-resolutions via the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html">get_parsed_packet_stats</A> function, so that you can make sensible choices concerning
the number of quality layers you are prepared to discard
in a time-constrained rendering application.
</P><P>
 If your application has previously opened the tile
and has since changed the region of interest, number
of quality layers, and so forth, it may happen that
some precincts have already been partially parsed and
then unloaded from memory. If this is the case, the
information returned via a call to 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html">get_parsed_packet_stats</A> will be incomplete, even after calling this function,
since reparsed packets do not affect the internal parsed
length counters.
</P><P>
 If you want accurate information under these conditions,
you can specify the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html#start_from_scratch_if_possible">start_from_scratch_if_possible</A> option. In this case, the collection of all precincts
in the tile-component-resolutions which are relevant
are first scanned to determine whether or not any have
been unloaded from memory after parsing, or any precinct
which is irrelevant to the current region of interest
has already been parsed, in part or in full. If none
of these are true, nothing need be done. Otherwise,
all precincts in the tile-component resolutions of
interest (not just those which are relevant to a current
region of interest) are unloaded from memory and marked
as never having been parsed. After unloading all such
precincts, the internal statistical counters for the
relevant tile-components resolutions are reset and
the function proceeds to parse just those packets which
are relevant.
</P><P>
 There are some conditions under which the functionality
associated with 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html#start_from_scratch_if_possible">start_from_scratch_if_possible</A> cannot be realized, in which case the function returns
false and no new information will be parsed. These
conditions are described below under the "RETURNS"
section.
</P><P>
 One consequence of the procedure described above is
that for randomly accessible codestreams, the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html#start_from_scratch_if_possible">start_from_scratch_if_possible</A> option can be used to force the statistics collected
and later returned by 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html">get_parsed_packet_stats</A> (with a non-negative 
<B>component_idx</B> argument) to correspond exactly to the currently selected
region of interest, as specified in the most recent
call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>, if any.

False if the codestream was not created for input,
or if 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html#start_from_scratch_if_possible">start_from_scratch_if_possible</A> was set to true and either:
</P><UL><LI>
Precincts could not be randomly accessed, so as to
be unloaded and subsequently reloaded from memory;
or
</LI><LI>
One or more precincts is currently in a state where
it has been parsed (fully or partially) but its contents
might be vulnerable to access by calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__open_block.html">kdu_subband::open_block</A> arriving on another thread. To avoid this possibility,
you should generally call this function immediately
after opening the tile &mdash; i.e., before using the
tile to instantiate any multi-threaded block decoding
machinery.

<P>
If true, the function tries to unload all existing
precincts from the tile-component resolutions which
are relevant, and reload only those which are relevant
to the current region of interest, so that statistics
returned via 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html">get_parsed_packet_stats</A> will be consistent with those that would be returned
if the tile had not previously been accessed. This
is not generally possible unless the codestream supports
dynamic unloading and reloading of precincts from the
compressed data source, via random access pointers,
or the existence of a compressed data cache, so calls
to the function which request this option may well
return false. They may also return false if any of
the precincts have been re-parsed or had their contents
accessed since the tile was last opened, so you may
need to close and re-open the tile to get the function
to return true with this option.
