Accepts the name of a monochrome image file and a single
threshold. The image represented by this file is stretched
(interpolated) or shrunk (decimated) to match the geometry
of the actual image being compressed (as represented
by the 
<A HREF="kdu$phics__kdu$_graphics.html#codestream">codestream</A>) and its sample values are thresholded. Locations
where the threshold is exceeded are deemed to belong
to the foreground, while the remainder is interpreted
as background.
</P><P>
 Note that the mask image (the one being thresholded)
is read incrementally, buffering the smallest amount
of data required to satisfy the demand for ROI information,
which filters through from the leaves of the compression
tree (
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> objects) all the way up through the DWT analysis system.

Name of the mask image, to be opened and used to determine
the foreground region. Currently, only binary PGM files
are accepted, although it would be trivial to add support
for other file formats. Note that the dimensions of
the mask image are arbitrary. The width and the height
are independently stretched to the dimensions of the
image which is actually being compressed.

<P>
Foreground threshold, expressed as a normalized quantity
in the range 0 to 1, where 0 means black and 1 means
white. Foreground locations must have sample values
which strictly exceed the threshold, meaning that a
threshold of 0 will produce foreground everywhere the
mask image's samples are non-zero, while a threshold
of 1 will produce an empty foreground.
