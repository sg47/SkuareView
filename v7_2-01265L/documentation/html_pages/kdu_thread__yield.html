Yields the thread so that the scheduler can run other
threads. This function is intended for use within spin-locks
and related constructs built from atomic interlocked
operations, in which a short wait turns out to be unexpectedly
long &mdash; probably because the operation that another
thread is expected to perform within a few clock cycles
is interrupted by that thread being rescheduled. Yielding
our own thread's execution slice increases the likelihood
that the other thread will be brought back to life,
especially important if there is only one physical
processor.
</P><P>
 Depending on the platform, the yield operation may
be limited to threads of the same or higher priority
only. Returns true if the feature is implemented; else
returns false. You should not use this function except
within a "spin-loop" which expects the condition it
is waiting for to become available imminently, but
finds that it has taken longer than expected (typically
based on a spin count), which may mean that the CPU
needs to be yielded back to the scheduler so that it
can satisfy the condition.
