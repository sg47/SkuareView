This powerful function is essentially used to convert
paths into filled polygon regions. The principle intent
is to allow an interactive user to map out the boundary
of a polygon region by drawing a path around it &mdash;
usually done in the 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_EDITOR_PATH_MODE">JPX_EDITOR_PATH_MODE</A> editing mode &mdash; and then convert the path into
a filled polygon. As described under 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A>, a "path" is defined by a collection of connected
"path segments", where each path segment arises from
a quadrilateral region with simple connectivity.
</P><P>
 This function uses 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A> internally to enumerate all the paths associated with
the current configuration. It considers only closed
paths (those whose 
<B>path_start</B> and 
<B>path_end</B> coordinates are identical, as returned via 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A>). If 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__fil$sed_paths.html#required_member_idx">required_member_idx</A> is -ve, the function fills all closed paths. Otherwise,
it fills only the closed path (if any) which includes
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__fil$sed_paths.html#required_member_idx">required_member_idx</A> amongst its members (as returned via the 
<B>path_members</B> array passed to 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A>).
</P><P>
 For each filled path, the function effectively deletes
all the path bricks for that path (these are the quadrilateral
regions whose indices are returned via the 
<B>path_members</B> array passed to 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A>) and replaces them with new quadrilateral regions
which fully partition the region contained within the
external edges of the original path bricks. Several
things are worth noting here:
</P><UL><LI>
The filled region fully covers all the original path
bricks which comprised the path, rather than stopping
at the path segments themselves, which run down the
middle of their path bricks.
</LI><LI>
The filled region is partitioned into quadrilaterals,
meaning that the filling quadrilaterals do not overlap.
</LI><LI>
The filling quadrilaterals meet one another at their
vertices. No vertex of one filling quadrilateral lies
meets an edge of another filling quadrilateral at an
intermediate position.
</LI><LI>
Connected path bricks either share a common edge or
else the edge mid-points which define their respective
path segments are identical. This second condition
means that the path bricks which define the boundary
of the filled region are not necessarily joined at
their vertices. Nevertheless, the filling quadrilaterals
which span these path bricks and the entire interior
of the closed path do join at their vertices.
</LI></UL>

A region large enough to include all points and edges
affected by the change. This region will be empty if
the function does nothing at all, because there are
no appropriate paths to fill.

Used to return an indication of whether or not the
function ran to completion. The value may be set to
false, even if the function has a non-empty return
region, if the number of regions required to complete
the filling procedure exceeds the internal storage
capacity, in which case the maximum complexity would
definitely be exceeded by the requested operation.
It may be a good ideal to call 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__mea$omplexity.html">measure_complexity</A> anyway after this function returns, if you want to
be sure that the filled polygons can be completely
saved in a JPX ROI description box, since internal
storage is usually sufficient to exceed the maximum
allowable complexity of a JPX ROI description box.

If non-negative, the function only processes closed
paths which include, as one of their members, the region
with index 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__fil$sed_paths.html#required_member_idx">required_member_idx</A> &mdash; there can be at most one of these, since separate
invocations of 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A> return disjoint collections of path members. This
index may, for example, be the index of a currently
selected region, as returned by 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__get$selection.html">get_selection</A>.
