Currently, this is the only initialization function.
It always initializes the object to convert from the
colour space described by 
<A HREF="jp2$erter__init.html#colour">colour</A> to sRGB (or to a luminance space with the sRGB gamma
function), if possible. In the future, we may provide
for the capability to convert between two more general
colour descriptions.
</P><P>
 Note that it is legal to call this function again,
even if it has been successfully called in the past.
This will have the effect of deleting the existing
conversion specifications and attempting to install
new ones.
</P><P>
 The following limitations currently exist:
</P><UL><LI>
The only enumerated colour space described by the JPX
standard which is not supported here is 
<B>JP2_CIEJab_SPACE</B>. It is unclear how stable this colour space really
is, since major revisions to the colour appearance
model in CIECAM97 have been proposed at least once.
</LI><LI>
Only some of the general ICC colour descriptions associated
with the 
<B>JP2_anyICC_SPACE</B> colour space can be converted. In particular, 3D lookup
tables are not supported.
</LI></UL>

<P>
False if the requested colour conversion operation
is not supported by the current implementation. Although
we endeavour to support the vast majority of JPX-compatible
colour spaces, we do not currently support conversion
from ICC profiles which use 3D lookup tables, or the
<B>JP2_CIEJab_SPACE</B>. Of course, it is also not possible to support vendor-specific
colour descriptions here.

Set this argument to true if you would like to avoid
(or minimize the likelihood of) gamut truncation during
the application of non-linear tone curves. Many colour
transformations require sample values to be mapped
through a tone curve back to a representation which
is linear with respect to radiance, wherein linear
transformations are performed, and the results are
subsequently transformed again through a non-linear
tone curve (typically the sRGB gamma curve). The tone
curves are implemented using lookup tables and the
inputs to each lookup table are clipped to the nominal
range of the colour samples. In most cases, the impact
of this clipping is negligible, but it may affect the
gamut if the source and output colour spaces have significantly
different gamuts. Especially for wide gamut input colour
descriptions, the use of a wide gamut mapping is desirable.
The current implementation uses lookup tables which
are twice as large as they nominally need to be when
wide gamut processing is requested.

<P>
Set this to true if you don't care too much about exact
colour reproduction, but speed is more important (e.g.,
for video applications). In this case, an approximate
opponent transform might be used, or primary transformations
might be avoided where the source and output primary
chromaticities are sufficiently similar.
