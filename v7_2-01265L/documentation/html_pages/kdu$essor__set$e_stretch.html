For predictable behaviour, you should call this function
only while the object is inactive &mdash; i.e., before
the first call to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>, or after the most recent call to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> and before any subsequent call to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>.
</P><P>
 The function sets up the "white stretch" mode which
will become active when 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A> is next called. The same "white stretch" mode will
be used in each subsequent call to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A> unless the present function is used to change it.
We could have added the information supplied by this
function to the argument list accepted by 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>, but the number of optional arguments offered by that
function has already become large enough.
</P><P>
 So, what is this "white stretch" mode, and what does
it have to do with precision? To explain this, we begin
by explaining what happens if you set 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__set$e_stretch.html#white_stretch_precision">white_stretch_precision</A> to 0 &mdash; this is the default, which also corresponds
to the object's behaviour prior to Kakadu Version 5.2
for backward compatibility. Suppose the original image
samples which were compressed had a precision of P
bits/sample, as recorded in the codestream and/or reported
by the 
<A HREF="jp2$sions.html">jp2_dimensions</A> interface to a JP2/JPX source. The actual precision
may differ from component to component, of course,
but let's keep things simple for the moment).
</P><P>
 For the purpose of colour transformations and conversion
to different rendering precisions (as requested in
the relevant call to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html">process</A>), Kakadu applies the uniform interpretation that unsigned
quantities range from 0 (black) to 2^P (max intensity);
signed quantities are assumed to lie in the nominal
range of -2^{P-1} to 2^{P-1}. Thus, for example:
</P><UL><LI>
to render P=12 bit samples into a B=8 bit buffer, the
object simply divides by 16 (downshifts by 4=P-B);
</LI><LI>
to render P=4 bit samples into a B=8 bit buffer, the
object multiplies by 16 (upshifts by 4=B-P); and
</LI><LI>
to render P=1 bit samples into a B=8 bit buffer, the
object multiplies by 128 (upshifts by 7=B-P).
</LI></UL><P>
 This last example, reveals the weakness of a pure
shifting scheme particularly well, since the maximum
attainable value in the 8-bit rendering buffer from
a 1-bit source will be 128, as opposed to the expected
255, leading to images which are darker than would
be suspected. Nevertheless, this policy has merits.
One important merit is that the original sample values
are preserved exactly, so long as the rendering buffer
has precision B &gt;= P. The policy also has minimal
computational complexity and produces visually excellent
results except for very low bit-depth images. Moreover,
very low bit-depth images are often used to index a
colour palette, which performs the conversion from
low to high precision in exactly the manner prescribed
by the image content creator.
</P><P>
 Nevertheless, it is possible that low bit-depth image
components are used without a colour palette and that
applications will want to render them to higher bit-depth
displays. The most obvious example of this is palette-less
bi-level images, but another example is presented by
images which have a low precision associated alpha
(opacity) channel. To render such images in the most
natural way, unsigned sample values with P &lt; B should
ideally be stretched by (1-2^{-B})/(1-2^{-P}), prior
to rendering, in recognition of the fact that the maximum
display output value is (1-2^{-B}) times the assumed
range of 2^B, while the maximum intended component
sample value (during content creation) was probably
(1-2^{-P}) times the assumed range of 2^P. It is not
entirely clear whether the same interpretations are
reasonable for signed sample values, but the function
extends the policy to both signed and unsigned samples
by fixing the lower bound of the nominal range and
stretching the length of the range by (1-2^{-B})/(1-2^{-P}).
In fact, the internal representation of all component
samples is signed so as to optimally exploit the dynamic
range of the available word sizes.
</P><P>
 To facilitate the stretching procedure described above,
the present function allows you to specify the value
of B that you would like to be applied in the stretching
process. This is the value of the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__set$e_stretch.html#white_stretch_precision">white_stretch_precision</A> argument. Normally, B will coincide with the value
of the 
<B>precision_bits</B> argument you intend to supply to the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html">process</A> function (often B=8). However, you can use a different
value. In particular, using a smaller value for B here
will reduce the likelihood that white stretching is
applied (also reducing the accuracy of the stretch,
of course), which may represent a useful computational
saving for your application. Also, when the target
rendering precision is greater than 8 bits, it is unclear
whether your application will want stretching or not
&mdash; if so, stretching to B=8 bits might be quite
accurate enough for you, differing from the optimal
stretch value by at most 1 part in 256. The important
thing to note is that stretching will occur only when
the component sample precision P is less than B, so
8-bit original samples will be completely unchanged
if you specify B &lt;= 8. In particular, the default
value of B=0 means that no stretching will ever be
applied.
</P><P>
 As a final note, we point out that white stretching
adds unnecessary complexity if you intend to use the
floating point version of the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html">process</A> function. This is because that function always performs
white stretching to the associated precision &mdash;
see that function for more information.

This argument holds the target stretching precision,
B, explained in the discussion above. White stretching
will be applied only to image components (or JP2/JPX/MJ2
palette outputs) whose nominated precision P is less
than B.
