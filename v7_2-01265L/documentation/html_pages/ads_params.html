This object works together with 
<A HREF="dfs_params.html">dfs_params</A> and 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> to manage the information associated with JPEG2000
Part-2 
<B>ADS</B> and 
<B>DFS</B> marker segments. Unfortunately, information which
is split amongst these various marker segments needs
to be processed jointly in order to extract any meaning
from the 
<B>ADS</B> marker segment. The reason for this is that ADS describes
the further splitting of primary high-pass DWT subbands,
to form packet wavelet transforms, but the number of
primary high-pass subbands and their properties depend
upon information contained in the 
<B>DFS</B> marker segment. These are connected only indirectly
through references found in 
<B>COD</B> and 
<B>COC</B> marker segments. To make matters even more complicated,
the connection between DFS and ADS marker segments
found in the main header cannot be discovered until
a tile header is encountered, in which they are both
used. In some cases, no connection might be found at
all, so that the information in the main header can
never be properly interpreted.
</P><P>
 To deal with the complications and uncertainties caused
by this division of information, Kakadu uses 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> to store the fully resolved and interpreted decomposition
style information. Specifically, this information is
stored in the single 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> parameter attribute. However, the 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> object also manages indices (references) of the DFS
and/or ADS tables from which this information was originally
recovered, or to which it must be written. These indices
are found in the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdfs">Cdfs</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cads">Cads</A> parameter attributes. The 
<B>finalize</B> members of these three parameter classes play a very
significant role in moving information between them
and assigning table indices, where appropriate. To
ensure that the logic works correctly, it is important
that the 
<A HREF="ads_params.html">ads_params</A> and 
<A HREF="dfs_params.html">dfs_params</A> parameter clusters be linked into the cluster list
after 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A>.
</P><P>
 This present object maintains two types of attributes.
The 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ddecomp">Ddecomp</A> attribute is absolutely identical to 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A>. In fact, it is always created by 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B>. The 
<A HREF="globals.html#DOads">DOads</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#DSads">DSads</A> attributes record the raw information contained in
an ADS marker segment. This information can be extracted
from 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ddecomp">Ddecomp</A>, but not vice-versa. The 
<B>ads_params::finalize</B> member performs this extraction if it finds that 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ddecomp">Ddecomp</A> has been filled in by 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B>, but the raw information is not yet available. The
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> function, on the other hand, creates 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> in the first place when it encounters a non-trivial
<A HREF="globals.html#Cads">Cads</A> index without accompanying 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> information; it does this using the raw 
<A HREF="globals.html#DOads">DOads</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#DSads">DSads</A> information &mdash; this happens when reading an existing
codestream.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "ADS", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#ADS_params">ADS_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 The various parameter attributes are as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#DOads">DOads</A>; Pattern = "I" [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; Number of sub-levels
in each successive DWT level, starting from the highest
level. Accesses to non-existent values are supported
by repeating the last available value. All entries
must lie in the range 1 to 3. For the meaning of sub-levels
in JPEG2000 Part-2, the reader is referred to Annex
F of IS 15444-2. You would not normally set values
for this parameter attribute yourself.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#DSads">DSads</A>; Pattern = "(X=0,H=1,V=2,B=3)" [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash;
Array of splitting instructions, whose interpretation
depends upon other information available via the 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> object whose 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cads">Cads</A> index agrees with our instance index. All splitting
instructions must lie in the range 0 to 3. The last
value is repeated as necessary, if accesses are made
beyond the end of the array. For the meaning of these
splitting instructions, the reader is referred to Annex
F of IS 15444-2. You would not normally set values
for this parameter attribute yourself.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ddecomp">Ddecomp</A>; Pattern = "I" [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; This attribute
is created automatically from information in 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A>. You should not set the attribute yourself! There
is one parameter for each DWT level, starting from
the highest resolution level. Each parameter describes
the primary splitting structure at that level (DFS
information), along with all sub-level splitting (ADS
information). The 32-bit integers used to build these
descriptions are identical to those used by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A>.
