The persistent mode is important for interactive applications.
By default, tiles, precincts and code-blocks will be
discarded as soon as it can be determined that the
user will no longer be accessing them. Moreover, after
each code-block has been opened and closed, it will
automatically be discarded. This behaviour minimizes
memory consumption when the image (or some region of
interest) is to be decompressed only once. For interactive
applications, however, it is often desirable to leave
the code-stream intact and permit multiple accesses
to the same information so that a new region or resolution
of interest can be defined and decompressed at will.
For these applications, you must invoke this member
function before any attempt to access (i.e., open)
an image tile.

 Evidently, persistence is irrelevant for 
<B>output codestreams</B>. For 
<B>interchange codestreams</B>, this function also has no effect. Interchange codestreams
have some persistent properties in that any tile may
be opened and closed as often as desired. They also
have some of the properties of the non-persistent mode,
in that compressed data is discarded as soon as the
relevant precinct is closed (but not when the containing
tile is closed!). For more on these issues, see the
description of 
<A HREF="kdu$ution__ope$_precinct.html">kdu_resolution::open_precinct</A>.
