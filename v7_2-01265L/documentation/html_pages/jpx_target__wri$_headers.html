<DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Call this function once all top-level codestreams,
all top-level compositing layers and all desired top-level
composition instructions have been added, and sufficiently
initialized.
</P><P>
 Also, if you intend to add JPX containers to the file,
you should have added at least one (via 
<A HREF="jpx_target__add$ontainer.html">add_container</A>) before this function is called for the first time.
Alternatively, you can invoke 
<A HREF="jpx_target__exp$ntainers.html">expect_containers</A> prior to calling this function for the first time.
You can always add new containers later, invoking the
present function again to write the new headers as
you go, but the internal machinery needs to know to
expect them before it starts writing the file.
</P><P>
 This function scans the various parameters to be written
into JPX boxes, reorganizing the information if possible,
so as to try to ensure that the generated file is JPX
compatible and maximize the likelihood that it can
also be JP2 compatible.
</P><P>
 All of the fixed-position headers are then written,
including the JP2 signature box, the file-type box,
the reader requirements box and the JP2 header box.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A> &lt; 0, all codestream header boxes and compositing
layer header boxes will also be written at this point.
Otherwise, the function writes all codestream header
boxes, up to and including the one corresponding to
the codestream whose index is 
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A> (indices run from 0), and all compositing layer header
boxes, up to and including the first one whose compositing
layer uses the codestream whose index is 
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A>. It may write more headers than you request, but only
to the extent that this is unavoidable given other
constraints &mdash; especially constraints set up by
the interaction between metadata that is to be embedded
inside JPX containers and links (cross references)
whose target write locations may need to be discovered
to generate such metadata.
</P><P>
 When used in this way, the function returns with a
NULL pointer, once it has written this limited set
of headers, leaving the application to call the function
again, with a larger value of 
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A>, once it is prepared to write later codestreams. In
this way, compositing layer and codestream header boxes,
as well as JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions
boxes), may be interleaved with the contiguous codestream
or fragment table codestream boxes.
</P><P>
 If you have installed a breakpoint using one of the
functions 
<A HREF="jpx$arget__set$reakpoint.html">jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint</A> or 
<A HREF="jpx$2arget__set$eakpoint.html">jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint</A>, the present function will return prematurely, with
a pointer to the open super-box associated with the
context in which the breakpoint was installed. In this
case, the function must be called again, until all
breakpoints have been passed (i.e., until it returns
NULL).
</P><P>
 You should be aware that in complex situations, this
function may also cause metadata added via the 
<A HREF="jpx$nager.html">jpx_meta_manager</A> interface to be written as well. This is necessitated,
for example, if such metadata is required to be embedded
within JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions
boxes) &mdash; see 
<A HREF="jpx$nager__insert_node.html">jpx_meta_manager::insert_node</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__add_numlist.html">jpx_metanode::add_numlist</A> for an explanation of this. In these cases, it is
possible that the function will also encounter metadata
that has been added with the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__add_delayed.html">jpx_metanode::add_delayed</A> function, which results in another type of application-defined
breakpoint, causing the function to return a non-NULL
pointer to an open 
<A HREF="jp2$1t_box.html">jp2_output_box</A> into which the contents of the relevant box should
be written. As with codestream and compositing layer
breakpoints, mentioned above, the function needs to
be called repeatedly until it eventually returns NULL.
</P><P>
 If this function does return non-NULL, the value of
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A> is recorded internally and used to override any supplied
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A> argument in each successive call to this function
until NULL is returned. This helps to emphasize the
fact that the caller is expected to issue a sequence
of calls to this function until it returns NULL, and
the entire sequence is to be interpreted as accomplishing
the originally intended action. It is important that
this sequence of calls is not interrupted by the addition
of new imagery or metadata &mdash; most of the time,
attempting to do so will result in the generation of
informative error messages through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>.

<P>
NULL if the requested headers have been completely
written. This does not necessarily mean that the function
need not be called again. Indeed, it may need to be
called again if the number of codestreams to be written
is greater than 
<A HREF="jpx_target__wri$_headers.html#codestream_threshold">codestream_threshold</A>+1. As explained above, this allows codestream header
boxes and compositing layer header boxes to be interleaved
with the codestream data itself, or with fragment tables
pointing to that data.
</P><P>
 A non-NULL return means that a breakpoint has been
encountered during the writing of an image header,
or the function needed to write a metadata node that
was added using 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__add_delayed.html">jpx_metanode::add_delayed</A> or an equivalent operation.
</P><P>
 If the breakpoint belongs to an image header, you
may write any additional sub-boxes of interest within
the returned super-box. If the breakpoint belongs to
a delayed metadata node, you are required to write
the box's contents only (as opposed to sub-boxes).
</P><P>
 Note carefully that the function may return the same
breakpoint twice, expecting you to write the relevant
content in exactly the same way on both occasions.
The reason for this is that a first "simulation" pass
may be required in some circumstances, in order to
discover the lengths and locations of boxes that are
the targets of link metanodes (cross reference boxes)
that might need to be embedded within Compositing Layer
Extensions boxes.
</P><P>
 You should call the function repeatedly until it returns
NULL, without adding new imagery or metadata in between
such calls.
