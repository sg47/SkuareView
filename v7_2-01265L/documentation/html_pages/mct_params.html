Manages the information associated with a JPEG2000
<B>MCT</B> (Multi-Component Transform) marker segment. Tile-specific
forms are allowed and multiple instances are treated
like components for the purpose of inheritance (see
the 
<B>treat_instances_like_components</B> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A> constructor).
</P><P>
 The purpose of this parameter class is to provide
the coefficients associated with decorrelation matrices,
offset vectors and dependency transformations, any
or all of which may be involved in the description
of the complete multi-component transformation.
</P><P>
 The instance number of the 
<A HREF="mct_params.html">mct_params</A> object is referenced by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_xforms">Mstage_xforms</A> attribute, which is managed by the 
<A HREF="mcc_params.html">mcc_params</A> object. These instance numbers must be in the range
1 through 255.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "MCT", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#MCT_params">MCT_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 The following attributes are defined. For an explanation
of pattern strings, consult the comments appearing
with 
<A HREF="kdu_params__par$e_string__1.html">kdu_params::parse_string</A>.
</P><UL><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mmatrix_size">Mmatrix_size</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Identifies the number of matrix
elements, if any, represented by this object. The actual
matrix coefficients are represented by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mmatrix_coeffs">Mmatrix_coeffs</A> attribute. Matrices are used to describe reversible
and irreversible inverse component decorrelation transforms.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mmatrix_coeffs">Mmatrix_coeffs</A>; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; Coefficients
of the matrix, if there is one, whose number of elements
is given by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mmatrix_size">Mmatrix_size</A>. The coefficients appear in row-major order (first
row, then second row, etc.). The height and width of
the matrix are not recorded here, but matrices are
not required to be square. For reversible transforms
the coefficients must all be integers.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mvector_size">Mvector_size</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Identifies the number of vector
elements, if any, represented by this object. The actual
vector coefficients are represented by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mvector_coeffs">Mvector_coeffs</A> attribute. Vectors are used to describe offsets to
be applied to the component sample values after inverse
transformation.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mvector_coeffs">Mvector_coeffs</A>; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Coefficients of the vector, if there is one, whose
number of elements is given by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mvector_size">Mvector_size</A>. Unlike 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mmatrix_coeffs">Mmatrix_coeffs</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mtriang_coeffs">Mtriang_coeffs</A>, this attribute contains the 
<B>CAN_EXTRAPOLATE</B> property, meaning that the last provided entry will
be replicated as required in order to provide the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mvector_size">Mvector_size</A> vector elements.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mtriang_size">Mtriang_size</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Identifies the total number
of sub-triangular matrix elements, if any, represented
by this object. A sub-triangular matrix is square,
with no coefficients above the diagonal and at least
one coefficient missing from the diagonal. A strictly
sub-triangular M x M matrix will have M*(M-1)/2 coefficients,
all below the diagonal. Matrices of this form are used
to describe irreversible multi-component dependency
transforms. Reversible dependency transforms, however,
include all but the upper left diagonal entry, for
a total of M*(M+1)/2-1 coefficients.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mtriang_coeffs">Mtriang_coeffs</A>; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; Coefficients
of the sub-triangular matrix, if any, whose number
of elements is represented by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mtriang_size">Mtriang_size</A> attribute. The coefficients are arranged in row-major
order. Thus, for a dependency transform with M inputs
and outputs, the first coefficient (first two for reversible
transforms) comes from the second row of the matrix,
the next two (three for reversible transforms) comes
from the third row of the matrix, and so forth. For
reversible transforms, the coefficients must all have
integer values.
