This object plays a critical role in the implementation
of any JPIP server which is able to support intelligent
delivery of metadata together with imagery to its clients.
It is used to build a tree-structured manifest of the
metadata which is available, together with pre-digested
information concerning the relevance of that metadata
to particular image code-streams, or specific regions
components or resolutions of those code-streams.
</P><P>
 The metadata tree need not contain an entry for every
single metadata box from the original JP2-family file.
Instead, the granularity of the representation may
be selected by the 
<A HREF="kdu$2arget.html">kdu_serve_target</A> object which creates and owns the tree.
</P><P>
 The elements of each metadata-bin are represented
by a list of 
<A HREF="kds$group.html">kds_metagroup</A> objects, connected via their 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#next">next</A> members. Each element in this list represents one
or more boxes (all JP2-family files are built from
boxes) at the top level of the contents of that data-bin.
The tree starts at metadata-bin 0, whose top-level
boxes are the top-level boxes of the original JP2-family
file.
</P><P>
 Amongst the list of 
<A HREF="kds$group.html">kds_metagroup</A> objects which represent the contents of a metadata-bin,
there may be one or more placeholder boxes. Placeholders
have a rich and powerful structure, as described in
the JPIP standard (to become IS 15444-9). In this case,
the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld">phld</A> member of the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html">kds_metagroup</A> structure will point to another list of 
<A HREF="kds$group.html">kds_metagroup</A> objects, representing the data-bin to which the placeholder
refers. The 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld_bin_id">phld_bin_id</A> member provides the corresponding metadata-bin identifier.

True if the group consists of a placeholder. Where
a meta group contains a placeholder box , it must contain
nothing other than that placeholder, and 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld_bin_id">phld_bin_id</A> holds the identifier of the metadata-bin to which
the placeholder refers. Also, in this case the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#box_types">box_types</A> array and 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_type">last_box_type</A> member hold the type of the box which has been replaced

 If the placeholder represents an incremental code-stream

Array of 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#num_box_types">num_box_types</A> box type codes, providing the types of all boxes which
are represented by this object, including sub-boxes.
There need not be one entry here for each box, but
only one entry for each different type of box, regardless
of whether it appears at the top level or elsewhere.
The reason for providing this information is to allow
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A> to determine whether or not the present group of boxes
contains any box types in which the client may be interested,
where the client explicitly provides a 
<B>metareq</B> query field to identify box types which are of interest.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld">phld</A> is non-NULL, this list should include the type of
the box whose header appears within the placeholder
box, but it need not include the types of the boxes
which appear within the placeholder's data-bin (see
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld_bin_id">phld_bin_id</A>).
</P><P>
 It can happen that this list is empty (
<A HREF="kds$group.html#num_box_types">num_box_types</A>=0). This happens if this group contains no visible
box headers. In particular, this happens if the group
represents the contents of a metadata-bin whose header
appears within a placeholder box in another metadata-bin
(and hence another metadata-group).

<P>
If the group represents only one box, this is the number
of bytes in the header of that box and 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#num_box_types">num_box_types</A> must be 1. However, if the group contains multiple
boxes, this is the number of bytes from the start of
the group up until the end of the header of the last
box in the group. The type of this last box is given
by the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_type">last_box_type</A> member. By "last box" we do not just mean the last
top level box, but rather the last box of any type
listed in the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#box_types">box_types</A> array, whether a sub-box or not. If the client asks
only for headers of a box in this group, the server
will only be able to avoid sending the body of the
last box in the group.
</P><P>
 If the box contains a placeholder, 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_header_prefix">last_box_header_prefix</A> must be identical to 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#length">length</A>, since the placeholder box itself represents the original
box header.
</P><P>
 If the box contains no box headers at all (
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_type">last_box_type</A>=0 and 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#num_box_types">num_box_types</A>=0), the value of 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_header_prefix">last_box_header_prefix</A> should be 0.

Holds the box type code for the last box in the group,
whether it is a sub-box or not. See 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_header_prefix">last_box_header_prefix</A> for more on the significance of final boxes. If the
last box is a placeholder, this member contains the
type code of the box header which is embedded within
the placeholder (the type of the original box which
was replaced by the placeholder). The "phld" box type
itself never appears within the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#box_types">box_types</A> array or the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_type">last_box_type</A> member. If the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#box_types">box_types</A> list is empty, meaning that this object represents
only the raw contents of a box whose header is in the
placeholder of another metadata-bin, then 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#last_box_type">last_box_type</A> will also be 0.

This member is -ve unless the metagroup represents
the CONTENTS of a cross-reference box, which points
to a location within the file's metadata. At present,
we record only the location of the first fragment in
a potentially larger list of fragments contained within
the cross-reference box. This might not be sufficient
to identify all of the additional metadata which should
be served in conjunction with a cross-reference box,
but it almost certainly is in practice.

NULL unless this group consists of a placeholder box
which references another metadata-bin. Note that incremental
code-stream placeholders stand for a code-stream which
is to be replaced by header and precinct data-bins,
synthesized by 
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A>. In this case, the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld">phld</A> member should be NULL, although 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#is_placeholder">is_placeholder</A> will be true. This condition uniquely identifies the

This member is valid if and only if 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#phld">phld</A> is non-NULL. It provides the data-bin identifier of

<H4><A NAME="scope">scope</A> [<A HREF ="kds$scope.html">kds_metascope</A>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Points to a single 
<A HREF="kds$scope.html">kds_metascope</A> object, which is used by 
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A> to determine whether or not the metadata group is
relevant to a client's interests and, if so, how the
metadata should be sequenced relative to other metadata
and compressed image data.
</P><P>
 If the object represents the contents of another box
whose header appears in a placeholder somewhere, the
<A HREF="kds$group.html#scope">scope</A> pointer will generally point back to the scope of
the group which contains the placeholder, but it need
not. In any event the 
<A HREF="kds$group.html#scope">scope</A> pointer should never be NULL.
