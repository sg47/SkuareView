Dear Customer,

Accompanying this message is a copy of the latest version of the
Kakadu software, including all of the source code and accompanying
documentation and build environments.  You may be receiving this
software as a new licensee or as an update.  In the latter event, you
may wish to review the "Updates.txt" file for an explanation of the
differences between this new version and the version you already
have.

Our records indicate that you have purchased a University Library license.
If this is not correct, you should contact NewSouth Innovations Ltd (NSi),
using the contact information available on the Kakadu web-site at
http://www.kakadusoftware.com.

You should note that there have been some minor changes to the license
agreements from Kakadu version 6 onwards.  If your organization currently
holds a separate Commercial license to the Kakadu software, which has not
been upgraded to version 6.x, neither you, nor any of your staff or students
should make the mistake of utilizing this Library license to build commercial
Applications for your organization.

If you are a new licensee, you or your staff or students may wish to join
a Kakadu discussion group at YahooGroups.  For more information, visit

home page at http://www.kakadusoftware.com

and source code.
