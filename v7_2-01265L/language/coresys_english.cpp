In practice, this means that you must prevent a default `Qstep' attribute from being synthesized at a higher level in the inheritance path (e.g., at the global level) by using one of the available methods to explicitly specify quantization step sizes -- you can specify a full set, or you can specify a single value and use the efficient `Qderived' option.\0"
