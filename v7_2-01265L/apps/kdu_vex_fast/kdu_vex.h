      /* This function is used to allocate the surface buffer memory for
         `vex_frame' objects.  It returns an opaque handle, which must be
         passed back into the `destroy_mem' function in order to properly
         destroy the resource.  The handle might be the base of an allocated
         block of memory or a much richer object, known only to the
         internal implementation of the `vex_frame_memory_allocator'-derived
         object.
         [//]
         The amount of memory which must be allocated is determined by
         the component sizes found in the `component_dims' array -- this array
         has `num_components' entries.  The structure of the writable
         memory surface returned via the `buffer' argument is determined by
         the `format' argument.  Currently, only two formats are defined,
         as follows:
         [>>] If `format' = `VEX_FRAME_MEMORY_CONTIG', image components
              appear as contiguous raster blocks of memory, one after the
              other, without any intervening gaps, either between rows or
              between components.  Each sample is allocated `sample_bytes'
              bytes of memory and the pointer returned via `buffer' references
              the first sample of the first image component.  In this case,
              the value returned via `frame_bytes' is the sum of the areas
              of each image component, multiplied by `sample_bytes'.  Also,
              in this case the value returned via `stride' is 0 and the
              value returned via `fully_aligned' is true only if
              the first sample of every line in every image component has
              a 16-byte aligned location in the memory buffer.
         [>>] If `format' = `VEX_FRAME_MEMORY_XRGB', there may be no more
              than 4 image components, all of which must have identical
              dimensions; moreover, `sample_bytes' must be equal to 4,
              meaning that the separation between consecutive samples in
              any given component is expected to be 4 bytes, not that each
              sample has 4 bytes all to itself -- if any of these conditions
              fail, the function generates an internal error through
              `kdu_error', so the caller must be careful not to hold any
              mutex at the time.  An attempt is made to ensure that the
              returned `buffer' is 16-byte aligned and that the `stride'
              (bytes between consecutive rows) is also a multiple of 16 bytes.
              The `fully_aligned' variable is set to true if and only if
              these conditions are satisfied.  For this format, the value
              returned via `frame_bytes' represents the accessible number
              of bytes in the `buffer', but is unlikely to be important.
          [//]
          Note that the function never returns NULL.  It either succeeds,
          or else it generates an error through `kdu_error'. */

  /* Notes:
       This object maintains three types of resources: 1) the compressed
     data for the frame, pre-loaded into `box' by the management thread
     during calls to `vex_frame_queue::get_processed_frame'; 2) an
     open codestream (created by the management thread after loading the
     `box' contents during `vex_frame_queue::get_processed_frame'); and
     3) a frame buffer, into which the decompressed samples are written
     by one or another of the `vex_engine' frame processing engines.
        Two organizations for the `buffer' are currently supported.  If
     `stride'=0, the `buffer' contains all samples of the first image
     component in raster order, followed by all samples of the second
     image component, and so on.  This organization is suitable for
     directly dumping the decompressed frame to a VIX file -- it is exactly
     the same order used by the "kdu_v_expand" application and consumed
     by "kdu_v_compress".
        If `stride' > 0, the `buffer' has an interleaved representation,
     with successive lines separated by `stride' bytes.  In this case,
     all image components must have the same dimensions, and all are
     represented with just one byte per sample.  The `sample_bytes' member
     will always be equal to 4 in this case and the `buffer' will always
     have an interleaved ARGB organization, with the B sample appearing
     first, followed by G, R and then A (alpha), within each pixel.
     The value of `stride' is selected so as to be a multiple of 32 bytes,
     so that all buffer lines can be 32-byte aligned.  Unused samples at
     the end of each line are undefined.  This type of representation is
     selected only if the `want_display' argument to `vex_frame_queue::init'
     is true. */

         returns true.  It is worth noting that some internal processing
         of the frame may already have occurred if a non-NULL `next_frame'
         argument was supplied in a previous call to `process_frame'.
         [//]
         If `truncation' >= 0, it is used to modify the factor which the
         object passes to `kdu_codestream::set_block_truncation'.  As noted
         in the description of that function, block truncation enables a
         reduction in decompression CPU time at the expense of image quality.
         On construction, the `vex_processor' object sets its internal
         `block_truncation_factor' to 0 (no truncation).  This internal
         factor is passed to each new codestream's `set_block_truncation'
         function.  On each call to `start_frame' or `process_frame', the
         internal `block_truncation_factor' member can be altered by a
         non-negative `truncation' argument, in which case the modified
         value is also passed to the `kdu_codestream::set_block_truncation'

         returning; it returns false unless the entire frame has been
         processed.
         [//]
         The `next_frame' argument is of interest only in multi-threading
         environments.  In particular, it provides a means to keep processing
         resources active even when we come to the end of processing a
         current codestream.  In the current implementation, the initial
         block decoding jobs for the `next_frame' are automatically
         activated when processing of the current `codestream' leaves the
         system under-utilized, in the sense defined by
         `kdu_thread_entity::add_queues'.
         [//]
         The main reason for limiting the amount of data processed in
         each call to `process_frame' is to provide a means to take
         advantage of a `next_frame' which does not become available
         until some time after the current frame has started.  This means
         that the first few calls to this function might provide a NULL
         `next_frame' argument, while subsequent calls provide an actual
         `next_frame'.  This is OK, so long as you continue to supply the
         same `next_frame' argument until the frame is completely processed.
         Moreover, any subsequent call to `start_frame' must supply the
         same frame as that supplied by any non-NULL `next_frame' argument
         here.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
         Use this function to start the engine's master thread and any
         additional threads which it should control.
         [//]
         The `num_threads' argument indicates the number of threads to assign
         to the engine; if the value is 1, Kakadu's single threaded processing
         environment will be used, rather than the multi-threaded environment
         with only one thread.  This is OK, since disjoint processing engines
         running on different threads have different codestreams and do not
         directly exercise any shared I/O operations.
         [//]
         The `cpu_affinity' argument determines which CPU's the engine's
         threads can be scheduled onto.
         [//]
         The `thread_concurrency' argument is relevant only for operating
         systems which do not automatically allocate all CPUs to each
         running process -- Solaris is one example of this.  The value of
         the `thread_concurrency' argument should be the same for all
         constructed engines; it should be set to the number of CPUs that
         you would like to be accessible to the process.  In most cases,
         this should simply be equal to the total number of frame processing
         threads, accumulated over all frame processing engines, or the
         number of known system CPUs, whichever is larger -- since knowledge
         of CPUs can be unreliable.
         [//]
         The `yield_freq' argument is passed to
         `kdu_thread_entity::set_yield_frequency' if non-negative, so set
         the frequency with which worker threads voluntarily yield
         execution.  This argument is irrelevant when running single-threaded
         engines.
         [//]
         If `double_buffering_height' is -ve, a value is selected automatically
         (may be 0 -- no single-threaded DWT), depending on the number of
         threads associated with the frame processing engine; otherwise, the
         supplied value is used to configure double/single buffered DWT
         processing for the frame processing engine.
      */
    void shutdown(bool graceful);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
         This function should be called from the queue management thread --
         the same one which called `startup'.  It requests an orderly
         termination of the engine's master thread, along with any additional
         threads which it manages, at the earliest convenience.
         [//]
         If `graceful' is true, the engine will shut down only after
         completing the processing of any outstanding frames and returning
         them to the frame queue via `vex_frame_queue::frame_processed'
         (or `vex_frame_queue::frame_aborted' if there was an internal frame
         error).
         [//]
         If `graceful' is false, the engine will stop processing as soon as
         possible and it will not return any partially compressed frames
         to the frame queue -- there is no need for this, since the frame
         queue keeps a record of all frames it has ever created, for
         destruction purposes.  If the engine is found to be blocked on
         a call to `vex_frame_queue::get_frame_to_process', the
         `vex_frame_queue::terminate' function is called, which ensures that
         this engine (and all others) will be immediately unblocked and
         that calls to `vex_frame_queue::get_frame_to_process' will return
         false.  For this reason, ungraceful shutdown is intended only for
         the case in which we want to terminate all engines.
         [//]
         Once an engine has been shutdown, it can be started again using the
         `startup' function, although it is unclear how useful this
         capability actually is.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
         It is not safe to invoke this function from more than one thread
         at once.  It is expected that you have a single queue management
         thread, which calls this function.
         [//]
         This function is where the queue manager does most of its processing.
         The function first checks to see whether any new active frames can
         be added to the queue without exceeding the `max_active_frames' limit.
         If so, their compressed data is loaded into memory and their
         codestream interface is created here.  Once no more active frames
         can be created, the function waits (if necessary) until the frame
         at the head of the active queue has been fully processed.  At that
         point, the function moves the head of the active queue onto the
         `processed_frames' queue (for safe keeping in case of an unexpected
         exception) and returns a pointer to it.
         [//]
         If new frames must be created, this is done using the supplied
         `allocator' object's `allocate_mem' function, which allows for the
         creation of custom display memory surfaces, if desired.  The
         present object can always be used as the `allocator' if all you
         need is to allocate memory from the general heap.  If a different
         `allocator' object is used, you must be sure not to destroy it
         until after the present object has been destroyed.
         [//]
         Note that this is a blocking call; it returns NULL only once
         all frames in the video sequence have been processed.
         [//]
         The caller may choose to write the contents of a returned frame to
         disk, blast them to a display adapter, or simply ignore them.  In
         any case, the retrieved frame should be returned to the present
         object by a subsequent call to `recycle_processed_frame', so that
         its resources can be re-used.  However, there is no obligation to
         do this immediately.  This allows the caller to maintain multiple
         processed frames if required.
         [//]
         If one of the frame processing engines calls `frame_aborted', the
         present function may throw an exception, as explained in connection
         with that function.  However, even if this happens, the object is
         not left in an unpredictable state.  It is possible to resume
         processing in the frame queue, since the exception condition will
         automatically be cleared.  In this case, the aborted frame will
         eventually be retrieved by calls to the present function -- it will
         be marked as aborted.  If the failure was caused originally by a
         memory allocation failure (i.e., `std::bad_alloc' was caught), the
         internal representation will hold `KDU_MEMORY_EXCEPTION' and the
         exception will be rethrown here as `std::bad_alloc' once more.
         Thus, exceptions thrown by this function can be expected to be of
         type `kdu_exception' or `std::bad_alloc'.
