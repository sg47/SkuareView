            The `java_name', `jni_name' and `java_signature' strings must all
         be supplied, representing compatible primitives in Java, for use as
         C-types in JNI implementations, and the corresponding Java language
         signature string.  You may not create primitive types which have no
         Java equivalents, although the Java equivalents need not necessarily
         have the same size.  The `java_size_compatible' argument should be
         set to true only if it is known that the `name' type and the
         `jni_name' type will always have the same size.  Data types with
         incompatible sizes will automatically be copied across interfaces,
         which may cause some inefficiency when passing arrays of primitives.
            The `csharp_name' and `vbasic_name' arguments supply compatible
         names for the primitive in the C# and Visual Basic languages,
         respectively, while `mni_name' supplies the name to be used in
         Microsoft's "Managed Extensions for C++" where we build bindings
         to C# and Visual Basic.  The `mni_size_compatible' argument
         indicates whether these types are known to have exactly the same
         size as the `name' type in C/C++.  You may not create primitive types
         which have no managed equivalents, although this should not be a
         problem, since there are managed equivalents for all Java types.
            The `allow_arrays' argument is true if arrays of this type are
         allowed.
            The `bit_depth' field should be 0 for non-integer types.  For
         integer-valued types, it should hold the number of bits (8, 16, 32
         or 64), with signed integers having a negative rather than a positive
         value.

         with the supplied `name', the function simply returns a pointer to
         the existing element, without creating a new one.  If `alias_name'

         NULL, which will usually trigger an error condition in the caller.

  /* Notes:
        If `property' is non-NULL, this function has been identified as a
     "get" or "set" interface function whose purpose is to provide access
     to a public member variable of the underlying C++ class or structure
     and `property' points to the relevant member variable.  This information
     is used to build interfaces to managed languages, including C# and
     Visual Basic, allowing application developers to treat the relevant
     member variable in the most natural way.
        The `bind_specific' flag is used only in conjunction with the "-bind"
     argument, although it is always set to false during construction.
     The flag is set to true only for those functions or classes which are
     specified by "-bind" arguments, either directly or implicitly.  If any
     "-bind" arguments were processed, a final pass through the set of all
     classes and functions sets the `binding' member to KDD_BIND_NONE
     if `bind_specific' is false.
        The `num_jni_args' and `num_mni_args' members are filled out during
     the initial search for bindable functions, when building Java native
     interfaces and Microsoft managed native interfaces, respectively.
     These members identify the number of initial arguments which can be
     represented in Java or one of the Microsoft managed languages,
     respectively, where any subsequent arguments must have defaults. */
