 Description:
   Defines the `kdms_catalog' class, which provides a NSOutlineViewDataSource
 object for the metadata catalog outline view available for JPX files.  The
 object keeps track of labels as they become available, as well as changes
 in the label metadata brought about by editing operations.  It builds
 organized collections of labels, which can be used to navigate to associated
 image entities and/or image regions.

     managed by `child_info'.  Otherwise, the new node is inserted within the
     children managed by `entry->child_info' and `entry' should
     be one of the entries in the list managed by the current node -- the
     `cur_entry' member points into this list, but not necessarily to `entry'.
       If the current node has `KDMS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' set, the
     `entry' argument MUST be identical to the current node's `cur_entry'

       The function's main features are: 1) it inserts the child in
     alphabetical order, with respect to the upper-case converted unicode label
     representation stored in `label_prefix'; 2) it recursively follows
     prefix node branches in order to insert the new child at the correct
     location; 3) if `child' contains the same label and link type as an
     existing neighbour, the function appends the `cur_entry'
     list from `child' to the entry list of the existing neighbour and
     deletes `child'; and 4) `note_children_increased' is invoked as required.
        In the event that `child' is deleted, in accordance with the third
     feature identified above, the function returns a pointer to the
     node into which the entry list was moved.  Moreover, in this case,
     the function invokes the `note_label_changed' function, to ensure that
     modified labels are loaded by the catalog view. */

     automatically invokes the parent node's `note_children_decreased'
     function.  If the node's parent is a prefix node which is left with
     at most 1 child as a result of this function, the prefix node is
     removed, collapsing any of its descendants back into its own parent.
     For this reason, you should avoid holding onto a reference to the
     current node's parent, unless it is a true metadata node or
     root node. */

     bother using this function in that case.
       For nodes with the `KDMS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' flag set,
     it is extremely complex to figure out how to extract children which
     belong to `entry' from the collapsed list.  Therefore, when this
     happens, the current function takes a short cut by unlinking all

};
  /* Notes:
      This object represents a single item which can be displayed within
   the catalog.  There may be multiple metadata entries within this item,
   but only one of them (identified by `cur_entry') can actually be presented
   at any given time.  The user can navigate between them using the arrow
   keys or indirectly via actions which invoke
   `kdms_catalog:select_matching_metanode'.
      For efficiency reasons, the initial prefix of up to
   KDMS_CATALOG_PREFIX_LEN characters of the label string are converted to
   upper case and stored in the `label_prefix' array when the object is
   constructed.  This is used for searching and other related operations.
   The full label text, on the other hand, is generated on the fly when
   required, so as to keep the catalog nodes as light weight as possible.
      There are three types of catalog nodes: 1) root nodes; 2) prefix
   nodes; and 3) metadata nodes.  Metadata nodes keep a list of one or
   more `kdms_catalog_entry' objects, each of which represents a single
   `jpx_metanode' where all entries in the list have the same label, for
   one reason or another.  Prefix nodes display a common prefix in the
   catalog -- the prefix itself is the upper-case string found in
   `label_prefix' and its length is found in `label_length'.  All children
   of a prefix node have labels which, after conversion to upper-case,
   share the prefix found in the prefix node.
      The `KDMS_CATFLAG_ANONYMOUS_ENTRIES' and
   `KDMS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' flags
   deserve some further explanation.  These flags are meaningful only if
   `KDMS_CATFLAG_HAS_METADATA' is set.
      `KDMS_CATFLAG_ANONYMOUS_ENTRIES' is set if the entries represent
   links with potentially different parents -- this is judged to be the
   case for any node whose entries have parents that are not in the
   catalog or whose parents are grouping links.  For anonymous entry nodes,
   there is no way to meaningful way to order multiple entries, nor is there
   much value in the user navigating between the entries, because they
   are all just links to a single target.  The `cur_entry' member may
   still point to the most recently selected entry, however, which can
   be useful for editing purposes.
      `KDMS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' is set only for grouping link
   nodes.  In this case, the children of all entries are sorted into the
   `kdms_catalog_entry::child_info' list of the entry to which `cur_entry'
   points and `cur_entry' is not permitted to point to any other element in
   the list of entries; the other entries exist only to keep track of the
   metanodes which are associated with this catlog node.  If
   `KDMS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' is set,
   `KDMS_CATFLAG_ANONYMOUS_ENTRIES' is also necessarily set.
