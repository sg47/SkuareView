 Description:
   Defines the `kdws_catalog' class, which provides a metadata catalog
 for JPX files.  The object keeps track of labels as they become available,
 as well as changes in the label metadata brought about by editing operations.
 It builds organized collections of labels, which can be used to navigate to
 associated image entities and/or image regions.

       be one of the entries in the list managed by the current node -- the
       `cur_entry' member points into this list, but not necessarily to
       `entry'.
         If the current node has `KDWS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' set, the

       label representation stored in `label_prefix'; 2) it recursively
       follows prefix node branches in order to insert the new child at the
       correct location; 3) if `child' contains the same label and link type
       as an existing neighbour, the function appends the `cur_entry'
       list from `child' to the entry list of the existing neighbour and
       deletes `child'; and 4) `note_children_increased' is invoked as
       required.
         In the event that `child' is deleted, in accordance with the third
       feature identified above, the function returns a pointer to the

       function.  If the node's parent is a prefix node which is left with
       at most 1 child as a result of this function, the prefix node is
       removed, collapsing any of its descendants back into its own parent.
       For this reason, you should avoid holding onto a reference to the
       current node's parent, unless it is a true metadata node or

         For nodes with the `KDWS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' flag set,
       it is extremely complex to figure out how to extract children which
       belong to `entry' from the collapsed list.  Therefore, when this

  /* Notes:
      This object represents a single item which can be displayed within
   the catalog at any given time.  There may be multiple metadata entries
   within this item, but only one of them (identified by `cur_entry') can
   actually be presented at any given time.  The user can navigate between
   them using the arrow keys or indirectly via actions which invoke
   `kdws_catalog:select_matching_metanode'.
      For efficiency reasons, the initial prefix of up to
   KDWS_CATALOG_PREFIX_LEN characters of the label string are converted to
   upper case and stored in the `label_prefix' array when the object is
   constructed.  This is used for searching and other related operations.
   The full label text, on the other hand, is generated on the fly when
   required, so as to keep the catalog nodes as light weight as possible.
      There are three types of catalog nodes: 1) root nodes; 2) prefix
   nodes; and 3) metadata nodes.  Metadata nodes keep a list of one or
   more `kdws_catalog_entry' objects, each of which represents a single
   `jpx_metanode' where all entries in the list have the same label, for
   one reason or another.  Prefix nodes display a common prefix in the
   catalog -- the prefix itself is the upper-case string found in
   `label_prefix' and its length is found in `label_length'.  All children
   of a prefix node have labels which, after conversion to upper-case,
   share the prefix found in the prefix node.
      The `KDWS_CATFLAG_ANONYMOUS_ENTRIES' and
   `KDWS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' flags
   deserve some further explanation.  These flags are meaningful only if
   `KDWS_CATFLAG_HAS_METADATA' is set.
      `KDWS_CATFLAG_ANONYMOUS_ENTRIES' is set if the entries represent
   links with potentially different parents -- this is judged to be the
   case for any node whose entries have parents that are not in the
   catalog or whose parents are grouping links.  For anonymous entry nodes,
   there is no way to meaningfully order multiple entries, nor is there
   much value in the user navigating between the entries, because they
   are all just links to a single target.  The `cur_entry' member may
   still point to the most recently selected entry, however, which can
   be useful for editing purposes.
      `KDWS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' is set only for grouping link
   nodes.  In this case, the children of all entries are sorted into the
   `kdws_catalog_entry::child_info' list of the entry to which `cur_entry'
   points and `cur_entry' is not permitted to point to any other element
   in the list of entries; the other entries exist only to keep track of the
   metanodes which are associated with this catalog node.  If
   `KDWS_CATFLAG_COLLAPSED_DESCENDANTS' is set,
   `KDWS_CATFLAG_ANONYMOUS_ENTRIES' is also necessarily set.
