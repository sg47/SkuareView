Description:
   Implements the `kdu_rgb8_palette::rearrange' function, which attempts
to find an optimal permutation of the colour palette entries so that
the palette indices can be efficiently compressed and lossy compression of
these palette indices should produce a reasonable image.  Of course, the
algorithm is sub-optimal (NP complete problem) and it can also be time
consuming.  The focus on the present implementation is making sure that
if the palette is already well ordered, it will not be disturbed by the
optimization algorithm.
   You must include this file only if "image_in.cpp" is used.
