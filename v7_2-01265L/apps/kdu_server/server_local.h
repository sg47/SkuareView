         `kdcs_tcp_channel::read_paragraph', which it uses.  The function
         reads an initial request paragraph, checking to see if it corresponds
         to an HTTP GET or POST.  For GET paragraphs, the function creates a
         complete new `kd_request' structure immediately.  For POST
         requests, the function also reads the entity body to recover the
         query string, if any.
         [//]
         The function does not block the caller; if insufficient data is
         available to completely parse the request, it returns false, but may
         be called again any number of times until the operation has been
         completed.  As with `kdcs_tcp_channel::read_paragraph' (which it uses)
         error conditions (e.g. failure of the TCP channel) will result in
         an exception being thrown, of type `kdu_exception'.
         [//]
         Upon success (i.e., whenever the function returns true), a
         new `kd_request' entry is always created and appended to the queue.
         If the request did not correspond to a recognized HTTP request,
         the request's `resource' string is set to NULL and all members of
         the `fields' structure will be NULL.  Otherwise, `resource' points
         to the original resource string (hex-hex decoded, if necessary) and
         the members of the `fields' structure are each set either to NULL
         (if the request field was not found) or to point to a pre-parsed
         null-terminated string, which has been hex-hex decoded if necessary.
         [//]
         Note that the `kd_request_fields.type' member may be derived
         either from an HTTP "Accept:" header line, or from a JPIP "type="
         request field in the query string.  The `kd_request_fields.target'
         member may be derived either from the resource string (after
         skipping over protocol prefixes) or from a JPIP "target=" request
         field in the query string.
         [//]
         If the request suggests that the TCP connection should be closed
         after the response is complete, the `kd_request::close_connection'
         member is set to true.  This is done if the request contained
         a "Connection: close" header or an HTTP version less than HTTP/1.1.
         [//]
         Exceptions thrown while trying to read the channel are not
         caught inside this function; the caller should generally catch
         them and close the channel.

           [//]
           There is no default timeout.  You can set a new timeout any time
           you like, even after a previous one has expired, causing a
           blocking call to fail.  In fact, timeouts do not prevent the object
           from continuing to transmit data on its internal holding queue.
           They are used only to unblock potentially blocking calls.
           [//]
           The present object only provides three blocking calls:
           [>>] `close' may need to block the caller until the internal holding
                queue has been emptied.
           [>>] `get_suggested_bytes' may block the caller until the holding
                queue is sufficiently empty to avoid excessive channel delays.
           [>>] `retrieve_requests' may block the caller until new requests
                are received.
           [//]
           The internal implementation currently allows for only a single
           thread to use these blocking calls at any given time, but this
           should not represent any limitation in practice.  The present
           function, however, may be called by a different thread.  This
           allows blocked source threads to be woken up from another thread
           by setting a timeout of 0 (or even a negative value).

         them for a valid auxiliary UDP channel initialization message from
         a client which has been assigned the indicated `channel_id'.  Invalid
         datagrams are discarded (to prevent excessive exposure to spam
         attacks).  Once a valid datagram is received, the sending address
         is passed to `kdcs_udp_channel::connect' to ensure that all future
         traffic on the channel comes only from the connected client.
         [//]
         If `event_to_signal' is NULL, the function blocks the caller until

         Otherwise, the function does not block; if no compatible connection

         in the case of TCP, the object may already have been used as a
         primary HTTP channel before being converted.  In the case of UDP,
         this function will normally be called immediately after construction.
         [//]
         The complete HTTP-TCP protocol involves at least two TCP channels
         (a primary channel for HTTP requests and responses, and an
         auxiliary channel for chunked data).  Similarly the HTTP-UDP
         protocol involves a primary TCP channel for HTTP requests and
         responses, with an auxiliary UDP channel for chunked data.
         [//]
         More generally, it is possible to manage a single JPIP session
         with N JPIP channels, where any or all of the N JPIP channels might
         have their own auxiliary channel (TCP or UDP) for chunked data, while
         requests/responses for the JPIP channels might be handled by
         anywhere from 1 to N primary HTTP TCP channels.  You can use the
         `event_to_signal' arguments offered by `retrieve_requests' and
         `get_suggested_bytes' to jointly wait for the conditions
         required to generate and/or transmit data for any or all of the
         JPIP channels.
         [//]
         The `max_intrinsic_delay' argument provides an upper bound for the
         window-independent part of the maximum time that we are prepared
         to wait for acknowledgement of a UDP datagram before considering it
         lost.  The actual acknowledgement deadline involves a
         window-independent part that is adaptively estimated, as well as
         a window-dependent part (where by window we mean the number of
         unacknowledged bytes in the transmission channel immediately after
         the datagram was transmitted) that depends upon the estimated
         channel rate.  The present bound is provided as a safeguard to
         prevent the internal algorithm from waiting inordinate amounts of
         time.
         [//]
         The `allow_retransmit' argument is also applicable only to UDP
         transports.  If this argument is true, datagrams that are considered
         lost will at least be considered for retransmission.  Otherwise,
         once the acknowledgement deadline is expired, the relevant data
         chunk will be returned to the main server application as abandoned,
         resulting in cache model updates.  Even if `allow_retransmit' is
         true, data chunks that miss their acknowledgement deadline may not
         be transmitted (or they may be retransmitted only a limited number
         of times), depending on whether or not they are explicitly abandoned
         by the client or implicitly abandoned by an internal
         auto-abandonment algorithm.

         You should note that this function may need to block the caller
         until queued data in an original HTTP channel can be transmitted.
         It is hard to imagine why this would not happen immediately, but
         just in case, you should be aware that clearing of the holding
         queue is subject to any pre-existing timeout.  If the timeout
         expires, the channel will be closed before the function returns.
         If this concerns you, you might like to set a suitable timeout
         before calling this function.

         estimator.  For HTTP-only transports, the suggested chunk size is
         probably irrelevant so long as the client has imposed a length
         constraint on its request.  For HTTP-TCP transports, the suggested
         chunk size can help the internal flow control manager to obtain
         feedback at sufficiently regular intervals.  For HTTP-UDP transports,
         the suggested chunk size is potentially even more important, since

         size and uses this also to inform the best choice of chunk size.

    void abandon_chunks(kds_chunk_gap *chunks);
      /* This function should be invoked only on UDP auxiliary channels.
         It is called with a list of `kds_chunk_gap' objects, each
         of which represents a range of data chunks that the client is asking
         the object to abandon.  Nominally, each referenced chunk that still
         exists within the transmission pipeline (in the holding or transmitted
         queue) is marked as abandoned and moved to the completed list;
         these can later be recovered by calling `retrieve_completed_chunks'.
         Abandoned data chunks affect the way in which the server responds
         to requests going forward, since their contents cannot be considered
         to have arrived at the client.
         [//]
         In spite of the nominal policy described above, the object implements
         a more devious and efficient means of handling data chunks which
         the client believes should be abandoned.  If they are already on the
         transmitted list, there is a good chance that they will arrive at the
         client anyway, so the object just sets an `abanonment_requested'
         flag in the relevant data chunk, but continues to wait for
         acknowledgement to arrive.  Processing proceeds as if nothing had
         happened, but if the acknowledgement does not arrive in a reasonable
         period of time (well after this function has returned), the data
         chunk in question will eventually be marked as abandoned and moved to
         the completed list.  To make sure that responses are delivered
         correctly, the server has to remember dependencies which exist
         between data chunks that the client asked to be abandoned and
         requests whose response relies upon these data chunks either arriving
         at the client or actually being abandoned.  So long as such
         dependencies exist, the requests in question must be kept open so
         that more data can be sent for them in the future.  The
         `check_pending_abandonment' function plays an important role in
         managing these dependencies.
         [//]
         It is worth noting that abandonment can affect data chunks which
         are sitting on the holding list, even if they have not yet been
         transmitted for the first time.  Chunks that have never been
         transmitted are abandoned immediately, so they will not even be
         transmitted once.  This might be useful if the client's window
         of interest has moved on. */

         with the indicated `qid' value or a smaller request ID value is

         [//]
         Data chunks of the form identified above, are found on the
         transmitted list (or possibly the holding list), with their
         `abandon_requested' flag set to a non-zero value.  Notionally, when
         a client requests abandonment of a data chunk, the cache model should
         be corrected to account for the fact that the data chunk was not
         transmitted, and then the response to that request and all subsequent
         requests should include (if delivered to completion) whatever portion
         of the abandoned content is required.  However, there is no
         fundamental reason why the server needs to abandon a data chunk
         immediately, and it is generally preferable to wait for
         acknowledgement of the data chunk, unless it is waiting for
         retransmission, since then abandonment will not be required -- the
         client is expected to cache any data chunks it acknowledges, even if
         it has requested that they be abandoned.
         [//]
         The one thing the server needs to be careful of is that it never
         issues a response terminating EOR message which indicates any kind of
         completion of the response (e.g., window-complete) to a request R,
         so long as there are outstanding data chunks from any request D
         (in any JPIP channel), whose abandonment was requested prior to the
         point when the reply to request R was sent.  In practice, the easiest
         way to handle this is to ensure that the `kdu_serve' object keeps the
         request R active, so that more data can be generated for it in the
         future if any data chunks are actually abandoned, until all pending
         abandonment has been cleared from the requests D upon which it
         depends.  Such clearing occurs automatically if acknowledgement is
         not received within an appropriate multiple of the observed
         round-trip-time.
         [//]
         If `max_qid' is -ve on entry, the function returns the request ID
         value (QID) of the most recent request for which any abandonment
         request is pending.  This type of call is generally made when a
         request is first processed, to determine the value of `max_qid' which
         should be used to check for dependencies in the future.  If
         `max_qid' is non-negative on entry, the function returns `max_qid'
         itself, unless there are no data chunks pending abandonment whose
         QID is less than or equal to `max_qid', in which case the function
         returns -1.  In any event, the function returns -1 if there is no
         pending abandonment of interest to the caller.  If there is any
         pending abandonment of interest, and `event_to_signal' is non-NULL,
         the function makes an internal record of this event so that its
         `kdu_event::set' function can be called once all pending abandonments
         up to `max_qid' (or the function's return value, if `max_qid' was -ve)
         have been cleared.
         [//]
         Note that a return value of -1 only means that there are no
         relevant chunks which are pending abandonment on the transmitted
         list.  There may, however, be data chunks on the completed list that
         have been abandoned for any number of reasons, including as a result
         of a client request for abandonment.  Therefore, the application
         should generally invoke `retrieve_completed_chunks' after calling
         this function and before generating any data for new requests, so
         that the process of generating new data is able to take previously
         abandoned data into account.

         the channel has been closed or a timeout has occurred.  It always
         succeeds, regardless of whether the return value is NULL or not.
         A non-NULL return value is used to return chunks which the caller
         must recycle immediately -- which may include those chunks just
         pushed in.  The caller should also use `retrieve_completed_chunks'
         to retrieve chunks which later become available for recycling.
         [//]
         For HTTP channels, the function always returns the list of chunks
         which are pushed in, copying them internally; this alows the channel
         to be passed around from session to session without blocking on the
         transmission of existing data.  Even for auxiliary TCP/UDP channels,
         the caller must be prepared to recycle chunks immediately in case the
         function returns non-NULL; it may do this if the channel has
         already closed down for some reason.
         [//]
         The `finished_using_channel' argument is meaningful only with
         auxiliary TCP channels.  If true, it means that there will be no more
         chunks pushed into the channel, so the internal machinery should
         stop looking for acknowledgement messages once all chunks have
         been transmitted and acknowledged.  Otherwise, the internal
         machinery still checks for acknowledgements which might be
         sent by the client as a means of verifying that the client
         is using the channel correctly.  This functionality is not really
         necessary, since if the channel dies while looking for an
         acknowledgement message, it will be shut down.  However, the
         additional information provided by this argument helps in debugging.

         this.  The current implementation simply returns true if the number
         of data chunks sent so far exceeds 2^23, in which case the caller
         should invoke `terminate_chunked_data' with an `eor_code' of
         `JPIP_EOR_RESPONSE_LIMIT_REACHED'.  When a JPIP client receives this
         EOR code, it would typically issue the request again, in order to
         receive further response data. */

         In this case, you should invoke this function once you know that the
         chunks most recently pushed into `push_chunks' constitute a complete
         response to the relevant request and that no further chunks
         will be pushed in until after a new reply has been pushed via
         `push_reply'.
         [//]
         The function terminates the chunked transfer encoding associated
         with the current response.  If the existing collection of chunks
         do not already contain a JPIP EOR (End-Of-Response) message, you
         can force the current function to synthesize one by specifying a
         non-zero `eor_code' argument.  In that case, `eor_code' should be
         one of the codes defined by the macros JPIP_EOR_... in
         "kdcs_comms.h".
         [//]
         For auxiliary TCP/UDP channels (those for which `set_auxiliary' has
         been called), chunked data is delivered all by itself but the JPIP
         standard requires each and every request to have a corresponding
         EOR (End-Of-Response) message.  If a request is completed, its
         chunk list might contain an EOR message when supplied to
         `push_chunks'. For all other cases, including requests which
         are pre-empted so that no chunk list is ever generated, the
         present function may be used to queue the transmission of an
         isolated data chunk containing a single EOR message with the
         `eor_code' reason code.  Calling this function with `eor_code'=0
         does nothing at all for auxiliary channels.

         are no longer needed by the transmission mechanism, because they
         have been acknowledged, abandoned, or else acknowledgement is not
         part of the transmission protocol.  Since transmission is
         asynchronous with calls to the `push_chunks' function,
         the caller must not recycle any pushed chunks until it gets the
         go-ahead from this function, unless the call to `push_chunks'
         returned a non-NULL list of chunks which must be recycled
         immediately (as explained with `push_chunks', the caller of that
         function must be prepared to recycle chunks immediately).
         [//]
         Applications need only call this function once to retrieve all
         completed chunks; typically, this should be done shortly before
         a call to `push_chunks' so as to minimize needless storage.
         [//]
         In practice, you will never need to call this function with an
         HTTP channel, since `push_chunks' always returns the chunks that
         are pushed in that case.  Nevertheless, there is no harm in calling
         the function, regardless of whether the channel is an auxiliary
         TCP/UDP channel or an HTTP channel, and this probably provides the
         best protection against internal implementation changes.  In fact, it
         is safe to call the function at any time, regardless of whether the
         channel has been closed or a timeout has occurred.

         [//]
         Similar to `push_chunks', but pushes HTTP reply text stored in
         `block'.  As with `push_chunks', this function does not block the
         caller.  It just enters the pushed reply text into a holding queue
         until it can be transmitted.
         [//]
         The `body_bytes' argument can take three different types of values
         as follows:
         [>>] If 0, the message `block' is an HTTP reply paragraph that is
              not followed by any body data.  The reply paragraph should
              terminate with a blank line, where each line terminates with
              a CRLF pair.
         [>>] If positive, the message `block' contains an HTTP reply
              paragraph that is followed by `body_bytes' of body data.
              The reply paragraph itself should terminate with a blank line.
              The body data appears within the message `block' as well, so
              the entire thing can be transmitted as a single entity.  The
              initial reply paragraph portion in `block' should contain all
              relevant Content-Length, Transfer-encoding and Content-Type
              headers for a legitimate HTTP response.  Either chunked or
              contiguous transfer encodings may be used so long as all
              headers are data appear within `block'.  The reason for
              supplying the `body_bytes' value in this case is only to help
              logging services record only the reply text, skipping the
              body data.
         [>>] If negative, the implementation associates the reply text
              supplied here with the data chunks pushed in via `push_chunks'.
              In this case, the reply text will not be delivered until
              the next data chunk is pushed in via `push_chunks'.  At that
              time, the implementation automatically adds the relevant
              Content-Type and Transfer-encoding HTTP headers, so they
              should not appear in the reply text passed in via the
              `block' argument.  In this case, as with both cases discussed
              above, the reply paragraph itself must conclude with a blank
              line.
         [//]
         As with all the push functions, it is fine to call this function
         at any time, even after the channel has been closed or a timeout
         has occurred.  Of course, if the channel has indeed been closed
         already, there is no hope of ever delivery anything, so reply
         text is immediately discarded.  You can use the `is_active'
         function to determine whether or not the channel has been closed.

         the `queue' and false otherwise.
         [//]
         If `blocking' is true, the caller is blocked until the function can
         return true, the channel is closed or a timeout occurs.  Premature
         closure of the channel may be detected by calling `is_active'.
         If the function fails due to a timeout, you can always set a
         new timeout (see `set_timeout') and continue processing.
         [//]
         If `event_to_signal' is non-NULL, the function does not block
         (regardless of the value of the `blocking' argument).  Instead, it
         stores the reference to this `kdu_event' object internally, so that
         `kdu_event::set' can be called once a blocking call to this function
         would proceed immediately.  The internal reference to the
         `event_to_signal' object is maintained only up until the point when
         the condition occurs (i.e., when a request arrives or a timeout
         occurs).  The internal reference to the `event_to_signal' object
         is also removed if the present function is called again with a
         different (possibly NULL) `event_to_signal' argument.  The event
         itself is not set inside this function, so a successful return will
         leave `event_to_signal' untouched.
         [//]
         If the channel is closed (even if unexpectedly), the function does
         not return false unless the internal request queue is empty; in that
         case, the function returns false without blocking the caller, or
         taking any notice of `event_to_signal', so you should check the
         status of the channel by calling the `is_active' function after a
         false return.

           complete, `started_bytes' holds the number of bytes we have
           transmitted.
           [//]
           The `abandon_requested' flag is true only if the client has
           explicitly requested abandonment of the transmission of the
           element -- can only happen for data chunks to be transmitted over
           an auxiliary UDP channel.  This is an important condition, because
           it means that the server must behave as if the transmission had
           been abandoned and the cache model is adjusted so that future
           requests may need to transmit some or all of the associated data.
           The way things are actually implemented is that the JPIP channel
           waits until it can be fairly sure that no acknowledgement is going
           to arrive (if the data chunk has already been transmitted) and only
           then does it abandon it.  To make everything compliant, the
           server needs to be careful not to send an EOR message in the
           response to any request on any JPIP channel which might indicate
           complete service of the request in question, until such time as
           the data chunks for which abandonment has been requested have
           either been acknowledged or have been properly abandoned back to
           `kdu_serve', giving that object an opportunity to generate more
           response data for the dependent requests.  We do this by keeping
           track of the latest request within each JPIP channel on which each
           other incomplete request depends.  Then we also keep track of the
           earliest request within each JPIP channel, for which there are
           outstanding transmitted data chunks whose `abandon_requested' flag
           is true.  These two pieces of information can be compared to
           determine whether or not a response can be terminated with an EOR
           code that contains meaningful completion information.  See the
           `check_pending_abandonment' function for further discussion.
           [//]
           The `allow_retransmit' flag is set only for UDP auxiliary channels.
           In that case, the flag is set initially to the value of
           `kds_jpip_channel::allow_retransmit', but becomes false if
           `abandon_requested' is set to true, or if the server itself
           determines that the data chunk may no longer be of interest to
           the client.
           [//]
           The `window_bytes' member records the value of the transmission
           window (total number of bytes in the transmission queue) immediately
           after the queue element was transmitted.
           [//]
           For auxiliary TCP/UDP channels, we send queue elements in pairs
           (or larger groups), wherever possible, so that the delay between
           their acknowledgement can be used to estimate the maximum channel
           rate R.  We also estimate channel delay D from the round trip time
           of queue elements that we are fairly sure were transmitted while
           the channel was idle (see below).  Using this information, we
           endeavour to keep the window size W (number of outstanding
           transmitted bytes) on the order of D*R (see more on this below,
           in connection with delay estimation).  We also endeavour to emit
           queue elements in such a way that the average transmission rate
           does not exceed the current value of R.
              To estimate channel rate R, we use `group_ack_time' to record
           the time at which the previous queue element in the same group was
           acknowledged.  Queue elements are considered to belong to the same
           group if and only if they have identical transmission times.  We
           also use `group_ack_window_bytes' to record the `window_bytes'
           member of the last acknowledged queue element in the same group.
           These values are updated for all remaining members of the group
           whenever an acknowledgement is received for some member (this will
           remove it from the transmission queue).  These parameters allow us
           to estimate the channel rate when element q is acknowledged at time
           t from
                 [W(q) - `group_ack_window_bytes'] / [t - `group_ack_time']
           where W(q) denotes the value of element q's `window_bytes' member.
           We actually estimate 1/R by recursively averaging the reciprocal of
           the above value -- that is, we take averages of time/bytes
           rather than bytes/time.
              If no previous queue element with the same transmission time has
           yet been acknowledged, `group_ack_time' and `group_ack_window_bytes'
           are both set to 0.
              To estimate channel delay D, consider a leaky-bucket model for
           the channel, leaking at rate R.  Let B(q) denote the fulness of the
           bucket immediately before element q is transmitted.  Then we expect
           the round-trip-time to satisfy RTT(q) = D + (B(q)+S(q))/R, where
           S(q) is the number of bytes transmitted with element q.  The problem
           is that we cannot directly observe B(q).  If B(q) falls to zero,
           the channel is idle -- the longer the channel is idle, the lower the
           channel utilization will be, so we don't want this condition to
           occur frequently.  However, the only way to observe the delay is
           indeed to allow B(q) to go to zero.  If R and D are constant, the
           minimum window size required to sustain a non-negative value for
           B(q) is W=D/R.  Accordingly, if we allow W to fall below D/R from
           time to time, those points provide us with an opportunity to observe
           the delay D.  The way we do this is by setting the window size
           threshold to 0.75*(D/R) whenever a new estimate for D or R is
           obtained.  We transmit the first packet in a group only when the
           window size is smaller than this threshold.  When RTT(q) becomes
           available for the first element q in some group (i.e., an element
           for whose transmission time differs from that of the previous
           element), we compare W(q)-S(q) with the current estimate for
           D/R. If W(q)-S(q) < (15/16)*(D/R), we form an instantaneous delay
           estimate from D_inst = RTT(q)-S(q)/R and incorporate D_inst into
           a recursive estimate for D.  This process may be slow to track
           the evolution of D, but should at least be stable.  To assist
           in identifying the first element in a group, we use the
           `element_in_group' member which counts the number of preceding
           elements that were transmitted concurrently with the current one.
           [//]
           For HTTP-only transports, there is no explicit feedback from the
           client, so we can only estimate the channel rate during periods when
           the TCP queue is full.  At these times, the holding queue will be
           non-empty for an extended period of time.  We estimate the
           channel rate R during these periods as follows.  When a holding
           element cannot be transmitted due to the TCP queue being too
           full, we set that element's `holdup_ref_time' member to the current
           time, which is guaranteed to be non-negative.  When an element with
           a non-negative `holdup_ref_time' member is fully transmitted at time
           t, the channel rate can be roughly estimated from
                 [`reply_bytes'+`chunk_bytes'] / [t - `holdup_ref_time']
           and the next element (if any) in the holding queue has its
           `holdup_ref_time' set to t.  When queue elements are added to the
           holding queue, their `holdup_ref_time' members are set to -1, so
           only those elements that are transmitted continuously (without any
           intervening idle time) from the point at which the TCP queue was
           full are used to estimate channel rate.
              As with auxiliary UPD/TCP transports, we actually estimate the
           channel rate R by taking the ratio of two recursive averages,
           corresponding to the numerator and denominator of the above ratio.
           Whenever we transmit a queue element for which `holdup_ref_time'
           is -ve, we progressively increase our estimates of the channel rate
           R so as to encourage more and more data to be pushed into the
           holding queue -- this gives TCP overflow condition an opportunity
           to occur again so that we can again observe the channel rate.  Of
           course, none of these observations will be possible if the client
           does not request data at a high enough rate to saturate the
           underlying TCP transport.  In most cases, clients should endeavour
           to keep response time under control by limiting the amount of data
           requested, but in that case we do not need a reliable estimate
           for the channel rate anyway.
           [//]
           We finish here by describing the retransmission policy for UDP
           auxiliary channels.  A reasonable upper bound for the
           round-trip-time of a typical queue element q is D + W(q)/R, where
           W(q) is the number of outstanding transmitted bytes immediately
           after the packet was transmitted (as recorded in `window_bytes')
           and D and R are the current estimates for the channel delay and
           channel rate.  This estimate is already conservative, since some
           of the window bytes counted in W(q) may be in flight within the
           channel and not contribute to delay.  In any case, we consider
           that a transmitted datagram has been lost if it is not acknowledged
           within A + F*(D+W(q)/R).  Here, D and R are the most up-to-date
           channel estimates, F is the constant `KD_UDP_RETRANSMIT_FACTOR' and
           A is the value of the `kds_jpip_channel::max_ack_offset' member.
           This last value is adjusted using a dynamic state machine, so as to
           avoid undue retransmission, especially when D and R estimates are
           unreliable.  Each time an acknowledgement is received for some
           queue element q, the value of A reduced towards
           Amin = max{0, RTT(q)-F*(D+W(q)/R)}, using
                 A -= (A-Amin)*0.125,
           Here, RTT(q) is the observed round-trip-time.  When transmitted
           queue element q is not acnowledged within T(q)+A+F*(D+W(q)/R), the
           element is moved to the holding queue and the value of
           A (i.e., `kds_jpip_channel::max_ack_offset') is copied to
           `kd_queue_elt::last_max_ack_offset'.  If this retransmitted packet
           is also not acknowledged in time, we increase the value of A
           by the value recorded in `kd_queue_elt::last_max_ack_offset'.
           If an acknowledgement is received from one transmission after
           that transmission has already timed out, we also increase the value
           of A; where the element is available on the transmitted or holding
           queue, we can figure out how much A needs to be increased to match
           the actual round-trip-time, since each queue element records its
           current and previous transmission time.  If the element has already
           be abandoned, we simply scale A by 1.25 in such cases.

  /* Notes:
        The list of transmitted data chunks headed by `transmitted_head' is
     ordered by transmission time, with the least recently transmitted chunk
     appearing at the head of the queue.
        The temporary holding queue has the same order.  Chunks are pushed
     onto the end of the queue and moved from the start of the queue onto the
     end of the transmission queue.
        Once a chunk has been acknowledged, it is moved onto the completed
     list from which it will be removed by subsequent calls to
     `retrieve_completed_chunks'.
        For an HTTP-only channel, all transmitted chunks are considered to
     be acknowledged immediately.  With this interpretation, most of the
     fields defined by this structure may be assigned meaningful values
     for a single primary channel or for an auxiliary TCP/UDP channel.
        The `first_elt_pending_abandonment' member is used only with UDP
     auxiliary channels.  If non-NULL, it points into the list of
     transmitted elements (or possibly into the holding list) to the
     first element whose `abandon_requested' flag is true
        The `min_max_abandon_qid' member records the smallest value of the
     `max_qid' argument passed to a recent call to `check_pending_abandonment'
     which returned true.  This information allows the object to determine
     when it should call `abaondment_event->set'.
        For UDP channels, we form a rough estimate of the packet loss
     probability as we go and use this to inform the choice of packet size
     through `suggested_chunk_bytes'.  A maximum value for the
     `suggested_chunk_bytes' is obtained by attempting to divide the
     `suggested_epoch_bytes' value into 8 data chunks, subject to the bounds
     imposed by `min_suggested_chuk_bytes' and `max_chunk_bytes'.  This
     provides us with an opportunity to monitor the channel statistics with
     some reliability between data generation epochs (each such epoch leads
     to a call to `push_chunks').  However, at high data rates, the
     suggested chunk limit might not be the most efficient one, especially
     when there is substantial packet loss.  To this end, we model the
     probability that a datagram is lost as P(q) = rho * (S(q) + Soff), where
     S(q) is the number of bytes in the datagram and Soff models the additional
     packet overhead for a datagram (typically IP headers).  The Soff value
     is stored in the `dgram_overhead' member and depends on whether IPv4 or
     IPv6 is being used. This loss model is probably reasonable so long as
     P(q) is reasonably small.  To understand how rho is estimated, suppose
     datagrams all have a fixed chunk size S and let NL and NA be the number
     of lost and acknowledged datagrams, respecively.  Then we expect to find
     that NL = (NA+NL)*rho*(S+Soff).  That is,
          rho = NL / ((NA + NL) * (S+Soff))
     Our estimation strategy for rho is based on the maintainance of two
     state variables, `dgram_loss_count' and `dgram_completed_byte_count',
     that correspond to the numerator and denominator of the above equation.
     Each time a queue element q's loss/acknowledgement status is finalized,
     we add S(q) + Soff to the value of `dgram_completed_byte_count'; if the
     status if finalized as a loss, we add 1 to `dgram_loss_count'.  Then
         rho = `dgram_loss_count' / `dgram_completed_byte_count'
     We periodically normalize these state variables so that `cum_dgram_losses'
     does not grow much beyond 4 -- this helps the estimator to remain
     responsive to changes in the loss rate.
         Given rho, we can calculate the chunk size S that maximizes
     transport efficiency (assuming an indefinite retransmission policy).
     Specifically, the efficiency can be modeled as
         E = (1 - rho * (S+Soff)) * S / (S+Soff)
     This is maximized by setting
         0 = dE/dS = (1 - rho*(S+Soff)) / (S+Soff) - rho*S / (S+Soff)
                   - (1 - rho*(S+Soff))*S/(S+Soff)^2
     Hence, (1 - rho*(S+Soff)) = rho*S + (1 - rho*(S+Soff))*S/(S+Soff)
     hence, (1 - rho*(S+Soff))*(S+Soff) = rho*S*(S+Soff) + (1 - rho*(S+Soff))*S
     hence, (1 - rho*(S+Soff))*Soff = rho*S*(S+Soff)
     hence, rho*(S+Soff)*(S+Soff) = Soff
     and finally we get S = sqrt(Soff/rho) - Soff
         In the above analysis, we have considered that all S bytes carry
     useful data.  This is fine, so long as we include the 8-byte chunk header
     as part of Soff and then later add 8 bytes to the optimal S so as to
     obtain the optimal chunk size with header included.  In practice, the
     `dgram_overhead' member holds a value of Soff that does not account for
     the 8-byte chunk header, so the optimal chunk size including this header
     is given by
     Sfull = sqrt((Soff+8)/rho) - (Soff+8) + 8
           = sqrt((Soff+8)*dgram_completed_byte_count/dgram_loss_count) - Soff
     The above equation is implemented inside `find_rate_derived_parameters'.
     As an example, suppose Soff=20 and rho=1.5E-6, then Sfull=4300, which is
     just greater than the largest chunk size allowed with the JPIP UDP
     transport.  On the other hand, if Soff=20 and rho=1E-3, Sfull=147 bytes
     which is starting to get very small.  These examples reveal the range of
     values for `dgram_loss_count' and `dgram_completed_byte_count' that we
     need to be prepared to accommodate.

  /* Notes:
       Requests which arrive on a primary channel go through the following
     stages:
     1) The request is associated with a JPIP channel (CID) by setting the
        `request_cid' member to non-NULL and filling in the `request_qid'
        and `request_preemptive' members.  At the end of this stage,
        `request_cid' is non-NULL and `request_processed' is false.
     2) The JPIP channel (CID) becomes available to handle the request; this
        may depend on the `request_qid' value along with whether or not there
        are other primary channels which, for one reason or another, refer
        to the same CID.  Once the channel is available, the request is
        processed.  This means, in particular, that the request is parsed
        for a window of interest and related parameters, any cache model
        manipulation commands are processed and reflected to the server's
        cache model, and `cclose' commands are used to mark the relevant
        `kds_cid' records for closure after the request in progress
        completes (or would be preempted).  At the end of this stage,
        `request_cid' is non-NULL, `request_processed' is true but
        `reply_generated' is false.  If the request cannot be handled
        properly, a suitable error reply is generated immediately during
        this phase and the request is popped from the head of the queue,
        restoring `request_cid' to NULL and `request_processed' to false.
        Otherwise, we move on to the next stage.  In either case, the
        request is popped from the head of the `pending_requests' queue.
     3) The request is either pre-empted, or used to generate chunks of
        data in one or more epochs.  In either case, an HTTP 200 or 202
        response code must be generated, the `reply_generated' member
        becomes true.  If the JPIP channel uses an auxiliary return channel
        (HTTP-TCP), the `request_cid' member is reset to NULL (and
        `request_processed' and `reply_generated' are also reset to
        false), while possibly leaving the relevant `kds_cid::is_active'
        member true.
     4) For HTTP-only JPIP channels, the `request_cid' member is left
        non-NULL after stage 3, with `reply_generated' true until the
        relevant JPIP channel (as identified by the `request_cid' member) is
        finished responding to the request.  During this time, the relevant
        `kds_cid::is_active' flag remains true and `kds_cid::primary' points
        back to this channel.  Only once the response process for that
        CID is complete or preempted, leaving `kds_cid::is_active' false,
        does the `request_cid' member get reset to NULL and the
        `reply_generated' flag (and the other stage flags) is reset to
        false. */

  /* Notes:
        If `channel_type' involves an auxiliary data channel, that channel
     is managed by the `aux_channel' member.  However, auxiliary data channels
     are not complete until the client has sent back an initiating message.
     Prior to that time, `waiting_for_aux_connect' is true.  TCP auxiliary
     channels are received directly from the connection server, until which
     time `aux_channel' will be NULL.  By contrast, UDP auxiliary channels
     are created immediately, in response to the client request, from which
     point `aux_channel' will be non-NULL, but `waiting_for_aux_connect'
     remains true until we receive a datagram containing the correct
     initiating message from the client.
        The `active_dependencies' array is capable of holding one entry for
     each Channel-ID.  An entry holds -1 if a current active request has no
     dependency upon the corresponding channel (other `kds_cid' object).  The
     entry holds -2 if we do not yet know whether we have a dependency on
     the corresponding channel or not -- this needs to be discovered by
     calling `kds_jpip_channel::check_pending_abandonment' with a -ve
     `max_qid' value.  Otherwise, the entry is non-negative and holds the
     Request-ID of the most recent request, within the corresponding channel,
     on which the current active request may depend.  What we mean by
     "depend" here is that a compliant answer to the request requires
     the `kdu_serve' machinery to first be notified of the abandonment
     of one or more data chunks (within the request on which we depend)
     since the client has explicitly requested abandonment of those data
     chunks, but such abandonment has not yet occurred because they are
     in flight and may yet be successfully acknowledged (in which case the
     abandonment will not be required for a compliant response to dependent
     requests).
        The `blocked_by_dependencies' flag is set to true inside
     `kd_source_thread::generate_data_chunks' if all data has been generated
     for an active CID, but the EOR message cannot be sent because there are
     unsatisfied dependencies recorded in the `active_dependencies' array.
     Once a CID enters this state, it remains active yet blocked, until one
     or more of the dependencies are satisfied, at which point it is allowed
     to make further attempts to generate data -- this may result in the
     blocked state recurring if there are other unsatisfied dependencies.
     In other words, an active CID with dependencies generates data like any
     other CID until all that can be generated has been, after which it waits
     until at least one of the other CID's on which it depends no longer
     has any outstanding abandoned data chunks on which the current CID could
     depend, at which point generation resumes.

      /* Here is an explanation of some of the less obvious parameters:
           `max_sources' is the maximum number of source files that can be
         accessed at any given time.
           `max_threads' is the maximum number of source threads which
         can be launched to handle client requests.  In practice, each
         stateless request requires a source thread and each stateful session
         requires a source thread.
           `max_cids_per_client' is the maximum number of stateful channel
         ID's which can be allocated to any given client (i.e., by any
         source thread).  In most cases, only one channel-ID will be used
         for stateful communication, but multiple channel-ID's are now
         supported by the "kdu_server" application.
           `max_chunk_bytes' constrains the size of data chunks used to
         deliver JPIP messages to the client.  These are the chunks used for
         chunked transfer in the HTTP-only transport mode, while they are the
         chunks on which flow control is built in the HTTP-TCP transport
         mode.
           `ignore_relevance_info' forces the server to use a naive (uniform)
         policy for allocating JPEG2000 packets to the transmission queue,
         rather than considering the relevance of different precincts to the
         request being processed.  You might use this if you doubt the
         reliability of any log-slope information in the codestreams being
         served (it is mostly for experimental purposes).
           `phld_threshold' determines the granularity with which JP2/JPX
         metadata boxes are replaced by placeholder boxes, for incremental
         transfer.
           If `password' is NULL, no external administration access will be
         allowed.
           If `caseless_targets' is true, the file system is assumed to be
         case insensitive and all filenames are converted to lowercase before
         passing them to `kd_source' -- moreover, when checking for sources
         which are already open (and hence can potentially be shared),
         a caseless comparison is performed.

         a valid JPEG2000 file, the function returns false.  In this case,
         a text explanation is written to the `explanation' object.  The text
         explanation is a valid HTTP status line starting with the status
         code (not 200) and finishing with the human readable explanatory
         message; no new-line character should be used, and the message
         should be no longer than a couple of hundred characters at most.

         in the stateless mode, deliberately not keeping track of the
         information which has been sent to the client between requests.
         Apart from this, the source thread created in this case behaves in
         exactly the same way as if `jpip_channel_type' were "http".  The only
         two channel type strings currently recognized are "http" and
         "http-tcp", but `jpip_channel_type' may hold a list containing
         either or both of these.

/* This class manages the connection establishment process, which is
 performed over HTTP.  It manages a pool of threads which are used
 to perform the connection establishment signalling.  The presence
 of multiple threads allows any single client to take some time connecting
 (possibly over a slow link), without preventing the server from
 connecting other clients.  TCP connections which have been used to
 service a JPIP session may be returned to the connection server if
 the client did not close them when it closed the JPIP session.
 Finally, this class manages the creation of UDP auxiliary channels as
 required, ensuring that they use appropriate, unique port numbers. */
