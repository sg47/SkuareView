       bit set to 0 (i.e. the packet was skipped).  Since no code-block can
       contribute to such packets, the index of the layer in which the
       block is first included cannot be equal to the index of a packet marked
       as empty.  If the inclusion tag tree decodes such a layer index, an
       error must have occurred and this exception is thrown. */

       the representation of any subband sample can never exceed 37 in the
       JPEG2000 standard.  This may be augmented by U, the ROI up-shift
       factor; however, there is no practical value in selecting U larger
       than the number of magnitude bit-planes in any subband.  Thus, 74
       is a reasonable upper bound on the number of missing magnitude
       bit-planes which can be signalled -- the bound is mandated in profiles
       1 and 2 and would be mandated in the standard as a whole were it not
       for an oversight. */

        The above exceptions may be thrown during packet header decoding.  In
     addition, if an illegal marker code is encountered while reading any
     portion of a packet, an exception of type "kdu_uint16" will also be
     thrown, having the value of the illegal marker code.  Marker exception
     throwing may not occur unless either the "fussy" or the "resilient"

  /* Notes:
        From Kakadu version 7, the role of `kd_buf_server' has been modified.
     Whereas previously we had a single `kd_buf_server' per codestream,
     possibly shared with other codestreams, we now have up to 1+N
     `kd_buf_server' objects per codestream, where N is the number of
     threads that could do work, but only one `kd_buf_master' that does the
     original allocation.
        Calls into `kd_buf_server' need to either be inherently thread-safe
     (because they are contained within one thread) or else protected by
     the relevant codestream's `KD_THREADLOCK_GENERAL' mutex.  On the other
     hand, calls into `kd_buf_master' are rendered thread safe through a
     combination of interlocked atomic operations and an internal mutex
     that is locked only when a new "mass allocation" need be performed and
     at critical points in its lifecycle (e.g., when sharing it with other
     codestreams).
        Allocated memory is managed in discrete quanta known as blocks.  A
     block consists of `KD_CODE_BUFFERS_PER_BLOCK' separate code buffers.
     Blocks are initially allocated from contiguous memory, but any
     collection of `KD_CODE_BUFFERS_PER_BLOCK' is allowed to constitute a
     block.  Memory is moved between the `kd_buf_master' object and its
     client `kd_buf_server' objects in multiples of blocks and the reporting
     of memory statistics is quantized into whole-block multiples.  Calls
     to `kdu_buf_server::release' collect the returned code buffers until
     one or more whole blocks are available, returning memory to the
     present object only in whole blocks.  The `num_allocated_blocks'
     member keeps track of the total number of memory blocks are currently
     outstanding, meaning that they have been allocated to `kd_buf_server'
     objects and not returned.
        Within this object, code buffer blocks reside either in the
     `release_list' or the `KD_BUF_MASTER_CCB_SPAN' entries of the
     `ccb_entries' array.  The `release_list' collects code buffers returned
     to the object via `release_blocks' until they can be examined by
     the `service_lists' function.  These are transferred to the
     `post_release_list' as soon as it becomes empty -- that list is accessed
     only from within the `release_list' function so we don't need to use
     interlocked operations.
        The `ccb_entries' array, together with the `ccb_get_pos' and
     `ccb_fill_pos' members, are used to implement a lock-free circular
     buffer to distribute allocated memory to client `kd_buf_server' objects
     that may be entered from as many as KDU_MAX_THREADS different threads.
     We now describe the way in which memory lists are enqueued (filled by
     `service_lists') and dequeued (via `get_blocks') to/from this circular
     buffer.
        The `get_blocks' function atomically increments the interlocked
     `ccb_get_pos' member, using the old value to deduce an index R into
     the `ccb_entries' array.  In this way, the relevant thread reserves
     the right to retrieve a list of blocks from location `ccb_entries[R]'.
     It must dequeue a non-empty list from this location to ensure deadlock
     free operation of the lock-free queue, so if the current entry at that
     location is NULL, it invokes `service_lists' and tries again.  It may
     be that multiple threads serialize through calls to `service_lists',
     but this is highly unlikely, because `KD_BUF_MASTER_CCB_SPAN' is
     larger than `KDU_MAX_THREADS'.  It may also be that other threads
     race around the memory pool and grab the memory allocated for us by
     `service_lists' before our call returns.  None of this should pose
     any concern, though; at worst, we need to call `service_lists' again.
     Threads retrieve the entire list from `ccb_entries[R]' using an
     atomic exchange operation.
        The `service_lists' function iteratively increments `ccb_fill_pos'
     to obtain an index W into the `ccb_entries' array.  If `ccb_entries[W]'
     holds a non-NULL entry, the function returns (it will be called again
     when needed).  Otherwise, it prepares an appropriately sized list of
     blocks and writes this list to `ccb_entries[W]' using an atomic
     `compare-and-set' operation (for safety).  An important question is
     how many blocks should be included in each list written to the
     `ccb_entries' array.  Each time `service_lists' is called, we figure
     out the number of blocks B to write to each entry as follows.  If
     `num_blocks_per_ccb_entry' is non-zero, we use this value, consuming
     blocks from the `release_list' via the `post_release_list'.  If we
     run out of blocks, we set `num_blocks_per_ccb_entry' to zero and
     generate any remaining entries of the `ccb_entries' array by allocating
     memory from the heap.  If `num_blocks_per_ccb_entry' is zero on entry,
     we calculate a suitable value by dividing the total amount of blocks
     on the release lists into N equal portions, where N is the maximum of
     `KD_BUF_MATER_CCB_SPAN' and `num_buf_servers', rounding downwards but
     not letting the value become smaller than 1.  In this way, we ensure
     that released memory gets returned in a reasonably even way to all
     threads that require it and we also ensure that new memory is allocated
     from the heap only when this is required.

     to evaluate a reliable count of the number of suspended bytes, which
     takes into account activity within the `kd_input' object of which
     the derived object might not be aware.
        The `alt_first_unwritten' member is used to keep track of bytes in
     the buffer which may be inaccessible while in the regular (non-suspended)
     mode, which may need to be made accessible while the object is in the
     suspended mode.  This member holds NULL until exiting the suspended mode
     requires `first_unwritten' to be truncated to account for a byte limit.
     At that point, it is set to the value of the `first_unwritten' member
     prior to truncation.  When the object enters the suspended mode, any
     non-NULL `alt_first_unwritten' value is copied to `first_unwritten'. */

         or 3) an SOP or SOT marker code was found, but followed by an invalid
         length field.  This third cause of failure is important since it
         prevents the function from attempting to consume an invalid SOP or
         SOT marker segment, in the process of which it might consume any
         number of useful packets, having their own SOP markers.
              A valid marker code must commence with an FF.  If
         `exclude_stuff_bytes' is true then the second byte of a valid marker
         code must be strictly greater than 0x8F.  Otherwise, the second byte
         is arbitrary.  If `skip_to_marker' is true, the function consumes
         bytes indefinitely, until the source is exhausted or a valid marker
         code is found.  In this case, the function returns false only if the
         source is exhausted. Otherwise, the function expects to find a valid
         marker code immediately.
             As a convenience feature, the function automatically skips over

         detect the end of the code-stream without having to explicitly check
         for an EOC marker; 2) we should not be overly troubled by EOC
         markers which arise due to corruption of the code-stream (this has
         quite a high likelihood of occurring if the code-stream is subject
         to corruption).
             In the event that the source is not exhausted but a valid
         marker code is not found, the function puts back any bytes it consumed

class kd_compressed_stats {
  /* An object of this class is used to monitor statistics of the compression
     process.  One application of these statistics is the provision of feedback
     to the block encoder concerning a conservative lower bound to the
     distortion-length slope threshold which will be found by the PCRD-opt
     rate allocation algorithm when the image has been fully compressed.  This
     allows the encoder to skip coding passes which are almost certain to be
     discarded.
        The current very simple implementation makes the naive assumption
     that the compressibility of all subband samples is the same, regardless
     of the subband or resolution level.  This is OK if the number of samples
     which have been processed for each subband is proportional to the
     size of the subband, since then the average compressibility is a good
     measure to use in predicting rate control properties.  In practice,
     though, delay through the wavelet transform means that the percentage
     of samples seen for higher resolution subbands is generally higher than
     that seen for lower frequency subbands, until everything has been
     compressed. Since the higher frequency subbands are almost invariably
     more compressible, the predicted compressibility of the source is
     estimated too high and so the predicted rate-distortion slope threshold
     passes considerably more bits than the final rate allocation will.  This
     renders the prediction excessively conservative for most images.  A
     good fix for this would be to keep track of the percentage of subband
     samples which have been compressed in each resolution level and use this
     information to form a more reliable predictor.  This improvement might
     be included in a future version.
        In multi-threaded applications, the system maintains one object of
     this class for each thread, in addition to a master object that is
     interpreted as the global statistics manager.  Threads update their
     local view of the compressed statistics each time a code-block is
     encoded and reflect this information to the global (or master) object
     periodically.  The object provides methods to facilitate this process,
     that we refer to as "transcription".

  /* Notes:
        The `quant_slope_rates' array holds the total number of coded
     bytes which belong to each of a set of 2048 quantized distortion-length
     slope bins.  The original distortion-length slopes have a 16-bit unsigned
     logarithmic representation (see discussion of the "pass_slopes" member
     array in the "kdu_block" structure).  The index of the bin to which a
     given slope, lambda, belongs is given by
         bin = max{0, floor(lambda/16)-2048}
     Rounding down means that 16*(bin+2048) is the smallest slope consistent
     with the bin, so that summing the entries from bin to 2047 yields the
     maximum number of code-block bytes which could be contributed to the
     compressed image if the PCRD-opt algorithm selected a slope threshold of
     16*(bin+2048).  Note, however, that bin 0 is different, in that it
     represents original slopes in the range 1 to 16*2048+15 (slope 0 is
     not a valid slope threshold).
        The `block_slope_threshold' member essentially gives the current
     conservative slope threshold to be used during block coding -- this
     is the slope we want when calling `get_conservative_slope_threshold'
     with the `assume_all_coded' argument set to false.  More specifically,
     `block_slope_threshold' is the smallest index into the `quant_slope_rates'
     array such that the cumulative number of bytes represented by that
     entry and all higher entries is strictly less than the target rate
     multiplied by the number of samples coded so far (plus some
     conservative extra samples).  The corresponding slope threshold is
     obtained by adding 2048 to this value, multiplying by 16 and
     subtracting 1 -- again, though bin 0 needs to be treated specially.
        The `remaining_slope_threshold' member plays the same role as
     `block_slope_threshold', except that it is based upon the total number
     of samples in the entire image, rather than just the total number of
     samples coded so far.  In this way, it essentially provides a
     conservative distortion-length slope threshold, which can safely be
     used to trim already generated coding passes from their respective
     code-blocks.  This value is used to generate the return value from
     `get_conservative_slope_threshold' when its `assume_all_coded' argument
     is set to true. */

      /* This function returns a pointer to the `kd_precinct_ref' object
         which manages the precinct associated with the next packet in the
         relevant tile's packet sequence (see below for the possibility of
         a NULL return value).  The function also returns a
         pointer to the `kd_resolution' object which manages the returned
         precinct and the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the
         precinct within that resolution.  The precinct itself may be
         opened, if required, by passing `res' and `idx' directly into the
         `kd_precinct_ref::open' function -- see description of that
         function for more information.
            When desequencing packets from an input code-stream, the caller
         should first invoke the returned reference's
         `kd_precinct_ref::is_desequenced' member function to determine
         whether or not the present function has done all of the required
         desequencing for the precinct itself.  This happens if the
         precinct is directly addressable via a seek address recovered from
         the relevant tile's `kd_precinct_pointer_server' object.  If
         `kd_precinct_ref::is_desequenced' returns false, the caller should
         proceed to open the precinct with `kd_precinct_ref::open' and
         parse the next packet using `kd_precinct::desequence_packet'.  This
         has the effect of updating the precinct state so that the next
         call to `next_in_sequence' can move on to the next packet in
         sequence.
            When sequencing packets for an output code-stream, the caller
         should usually open the precinct and then call
         `kd_precinct::write_packet'.  Again, this enables the next call
         to `next_in_sequence' to move on to the next packet in sequence.
            If the caller does not actually take steps to desequence the
         next input packet or to write the next output packet, subsequent
         calls to this function will return exactly with exactly the same
         precinct reference.  This allows the caller to delay its packet
         parsing or generation activities.
             For both input and output codestreams, this function may return
         NULL.   In either case, a NULL return value means that
         no further packets can be sequenced based on the information
         available for the current tile-part.  For output codestreams, a
         NULL return value means that the caller must write another tile-part
         (or simulate such an activity).  After such an activity, the
         next call to this function will have access to the packet sequencing
         specifications in a new POC marker segment (if this were not possible
         the function would have generated a terminal error instead of
         returning NULL).  For input codestreams, a NULL return value means
         that the caller must advance to a new tile-part.  There are two
         possible reasons for this: 1) a new POC marker segment may be
         required to obtain sequencing specifications for the next packet;
         or 2) the `kd_precinct_pointer_server::get_precinct_address' function
         might have returned -1, meaning that precincts are addressable, but
         the first packet of the next precinct belongs to the tile's next
         tile-part.
             The function also returns NULL if all packets have been
         transferred to or from the code-stream. This event may be detected
         by checking the tile's `sequenced_relevant_packets' field; the value
         of that field is advanced by `kd_precinct::desequence_packet' when
         it is called or from within the present function if the precinct
         is addressable (this is the condition under which the returned
         reference's `kd_precinct_ref::is_desequenced' returns true
         immediately). */

  /* This object manages a single collection of resolution length constraints,
     as provided via the `Creslengths' coding parameter attribute.  There
     are potentially (1+T)*(1+C) of these objects in a codestream, where T
     is the number of tiles and C is the number of image components.  These
     correspond to one global form, C component-specific forms, T
     tile-specific forms and C*T tile-component-specific forms.
        `num_specs' and `specs' together hold the parameter values actually
     extracted from the relevant `Creslengths' attribute, via the `init'
     function.  These together represent a collection of limits on the
     number of bytes at one or more resolutions, potentially for more than
     one quality layer.  Quality layers are separated by 0's in the
     `specs' array.
        `max_bytes' holds one limit for each potential resolution, starting
     from the full resolution and working down.  The entries in this array
     are derived from the `specs' array, for the quality layer whose index
     is passed to `set_layer'.
        `num_bytes[d]' holds the cumulative number of bytes for all packets
     whose lengths have been passed to `check_packet' so far, for packets
     at depth d or deeper.  This value is compared with `max_bytes[d]' to
     determine whether the resolution length constraint at depth d has been
     violated.
        `prev_layer_bytes' is used to initialize the `num_bytes' entries
     at the start of each new quality layer, based on the total number of
     bytes accumulated by `check_packet' in the previous layer, if any.
        The `redirect' array's entries normally all point to the current
     object.  However, the `Cagglengths' attribute may be used to redirect
     the accumulated packet bytes from one component-specific object to
     another component specific reslength checker, so that the entries at
     the corresponding depth in that object are used to accumulate and
     check aggregated byte counts.  The pointers found in the `redirect'
     array always reference an object that lies within the same tile
     as the current one (or globally if the current object is global). */

     component-resolution covered by tiles which have already been opened and
     have precincts which contribute to the component-resolution.
        `area_covered_by_tiles' is the area associated with the portion of this

     component-resolution or not.  The ratio between `area_used_by_tiles' and
     `area_covered_by_tiles' is used to estimate the proportion of the
     remaining area which is likely to contribute precincts.
        `remaining_area' is the maximum area for which precincts must still
     be written to the code-stream.  This is equal to `total_area' minus
     `area_unused_by_tiles' minus the total area associated with all precincts
     in this component-resolution for which at least one packet has already
     been written out to the code-stream.
        `ready_area' is the area associated with all precincts in the
     ready list headed by `first_ready'.  The ready precincts have been fully
     generated, but none of their packets have yet been written to the
     code-stream.  Whenever it is done, rate allocation is performed on these

        `expected_area' represents the total remaining area covered by current
     and expected future ready precincts.  A -ve value means that this
     quantity needs to be recomputed, in which case it is obtained from the
     following expression:
             expected_area = (`remaining_area'-T)
                           + T * (`area_used_by_tiles'/`area_covered_by_tiles')
             where  T = `total_area' - `area_covered_by_tiles'
     The computed value is rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest integer.
        `attributed_area' is derived by accumulating the `expected_area'
     values from all lower resolution levels for which `ready_area' is
     currently 0.  The main purpose of this member is to detect changes
     that may occur.
        `ready_fraction' holds a quantity in the range 0 to 1, representing
     the value `ready_area' / (`expected_area' + `attributed_area').
     Similarly, `reciprocal_fraction' holds the ratio
     (`expected_area' + `attributed_area') / `ready_area'.  Both quantities
     are -ve if their values need to be recomputed or if `ready_area' is 0.

          The `hor_depth' and `vert_depth' arrays contain information which
       might be affected by DFS marker segments in the codestream's main
       header.  The values of `hor_depth'[d] and `vert_depth'[d] identify
       the total number of horizontal and vertical low-pass filtering and
       downsampling stages which are involved in creating the resolution
       level which is `d' levels below the original full image resolution.
       Neither value may exceed d.  Thus, `hor_depth'[0] and `vert_depth'[0]
       are guaranteed to equal zero -- these entries exist only to make the
       implementation more regular.  Codestreams conforming to JPEG2000
       Part-1 must have `hor_depth'[d] = `vert_depth'[d] = d for all d.
       Part-2 codestreams, however, may have custom downsampling factor
       styles (represented by DFS marker segments in the main header).
          The `apparent_idx' and `from_apparent' members are provided
       because the `kdu_codestream' interface (and its descendants) might
       be limited to exposing only a subset of the actual image components
       which are available.  This subset is selected via
       `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions'.  The `apparent_idx'

       codestream image component, as it appears to the external API.  This
       value will be 0 if the component is not visible across the API.  The
       `from_apparent' member is used to translate apparent component
       indices into true codestream component indices.  Specifically, the
       `kd_codestream::comp_info[c].from_apparent' member points to the
       particular entry in the `kd_codestream::comp_info' array which
       represents the true codestream image component whose apparent index is

  /* Notes:
        This structure is used to describe the image components produced at
     the output of any given MCT transform (synthesis) stage.  It is
     also used to describe the image components at the output of the
     multi-component transform from a global perspective.  The `is_signed'
     and `precision' members are meaningful only where this record is
     found at the output of the last MCT stage in the inverse multi-component
     transform, or in the global `output_comp_info' array managed by
     `kd_codestream'.
        If the inverse multi-component transform does not produce any data for
     this output component, its `subsampling_ref' member is NULL.  Otherwise
     `subsampling_ref' points to the `kd_comp_info' structure which describes
     any of the codestream image components which is involved in
     reconstructing this output component -- it does not matter which one.
     The purpose of this reference is to facilitate the determination of the
     dimensions and sub-sampling attributes of the relevant output component.
     All codestream image components involved in the reconstruction of
     any given MCT output component must have identical dimensions, so it
     is sufficient to reference only one of them.
        The `apparent_idx' and `from_apparent' members work in exactly the
     same way as their namesakes in `kd_comp_info' to facilitate translation
     between true image component indices and apparent image component
     indices, as presented to the application.  The only difference is
     that `from_apparent' is the index (rather than the address) of the
     true output image component which appears to have the index of the
     current component.  The apparent component indices are influenced by
     calls to the second form of the `kdu_codestream::change_appearance'
     function.
        The last four members are used only when the object is found in
     the `output_comp_info' array of a `kd_mct_stage' object.  In this case,
     `block' points to the MCT transform block which is used to produce this
     component within the relevant stage, while `block_comp_idx' indicates
     which of the output components from that transform stage corresponds
     to the current component.  The `apparent_block_comp_idx' member
     identifies the apparent index of this output component within the
     referenced transform block, which may be smaller than `block_comp_idx'
     if some earlier output components from the transform block are not
     apparent.  This value is guaranteed to lie between 0 and
     `block->num_apparent_outputs'-1.  `is_of_interest' is set to false
     if and only if `apparent_idx' is negative, except in the final
     transform stage, where it is also set to false if the corresponding
     component is not of interest to the application, as identified by
     calls to `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'.
        If the object is found in `kd_codestream::output_comp_info',
     the `block' member will be NULL and `block_comp_idx',
     `apparent_block_idx' and `is_of_interest' have no meaning. */

         strictly greater than the `max_output_idx' value, to indicate that
         the range of affected stage outputs is empty so far.  On exit,
         the `min_output_idx' and `max_output_idx' arguments represent the

         quite a bit of wasted effort when there are a very large number
         of components.

  /* Notes:
        This structure manages a single transform block within a stage of the
     multi-component transform.  Most types of transform blocks have an
     identical number of input and output components, but irreversible
     decorrelation transforms can have more or less output components than
     input components.
        The `input_indices' array provides the indices of the stage input
     components which are used by this block.  These must lie in the range
     0 to `stage->num_input_components'-1.  Moreover, if this is not the
     first stage, these same indices may be used to address the
     `stage->prev_stage->output_comp_info' array, to discover how the input
     components are produced.
        The output_indices' array provides the indices of the stage output
     components which are produced by this block.  These indices may be
     used to address the `stage->output_comp_info' array to discover whether
     each output component is apparent or not, amongst other things.
        The `ss_models' array is created and manipulated by calls to the
     `analyze_sensitivity' function.  If non-NULL, the array contains
     `num_inputs' entries, each of which identifies the linearized
     contribution of a unit change in the corresponding input to the
     block's output components.  For reasons of efficiency, each input
     identifies the range of block output indices which it affects, via the
     corresponding `kd_mct_ss_model::range_min' and
     `kd_mct_ss_model::range_len' members.  The contribution of each input
     to the affected block outputs is given by its `kd_mct_ss_model::ss_vals'
     array, with length `kd_mct_ss_model::range_len'.  This array is created
     (set to a non-NULL value) only on demand.  Note also that the
     `kd_mct_ss_model::ss_vals' arrays can be allocated in a variety of
     ways and can be shared between different input models, wherever this
     allows for improved efficiency.  This is achieved by separately
     keeping track of actual allocated memory blocks via the
     `kd_mct_ss_model::ss_handle' members.
        Each transform block notionally has an offset vector, whose
     elements are to be added to the output component samples as the final
     step in the transform process.  If `offset_params' is non-NULL, the
     offsets are derived from its `Mvector' attribute.  Otherwise, the
     offsets are all 0.
        If `matrix_params', `triang_params' and `dwt_step_info' are all NULL,
     the transform block does nothing else.  We refer to blocks of this form
     as "NULL blocks".  NULL blocks map their i'th input component to their
     i'th output component, with the possible addition of an offset from
     `offset_params'.  NULL blocks are useful primarily as a tool for
     discarding certain input components, since only the first
     `num_outputs' components find their way through the block.  They are
     also useful for introducing permutations and offsets.  The JPEG2000
     standard, Part 2, refers to NULL transform blocks in this same sense,
     although the text in the standard is potentially unclear.
        For NULL transform blocks, the `is_reversible' flag will be false.
     For all other types of transform blocks, the `is_reversible' flag plays
     an important role in determining how the transformation is implemented.
        Apart from NULL transform blocks, there are four other types of
     transforms:
     [>>] Irreversible decorrelation transforms are described by a matrix,
          whose coefficients are provided by the `Mmatrix' attribute
          managed by `matrix_params'.  This type of transform is used if
          `matrix_params' is non-NULL and `is_reversible' is false.
     [>>] Reversible decorrelation transforms are described by a matrix
          of SERM factorization coefficients.  In this case, `is_reversible'
          is true and the value of `num_outputs' must equal `num_inputs'.
          Codestreams generated prior to v6.0 will have `old_mat_xforms'
          non-NULL, in which case the corresponding matrix coefficients
          have an organization with `num_outputs' rows and `num_outputs'+1
          columns, where the columns represent successive lifting steps.
          Codestreams generated from v6.0 onwards have `matrix_xforms'
          non-NULL, in which case the matrix coefficients have an organization
          with `num_outputs'+1 rows and `num_outputs' columns, where the
          rows represent successive lifting steps.  This matrix organization
          is transposed in answering calls to `kdu_tile::get_mct_rxform_info'.
     [>>] Reversible or irreversible dependency transform.  In this case,
          the `triang_params' member is non-NULL and its `Mtriang'
          attribute is used to access the transform coefficients.
     [>>] Reversible or irreversible DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform).  In
          this case, `dwt_step_info' is non-NULL.  The DWT transform kernel

          `dwt_symmetric', `dwt_symmetric_extension' and `dwt_coefficients'
          members.  The number of DWT levels to be applied is described by
          the `dwt_num_levels' member, and the canvas origin which defines
          the coordinate system for the DWT is given by `dwt_canvas_origin'.
          The regions of support occupied by each of the synthesis filters
          are identified by the `dwt_low_synth_min' through
          `dwt_high_synth_max' members.
     
        All transform coefficients and offsets are represented using the
     normalization conventions of the JPEG2000 marker segments from which
     they are derived.  This convention means that the supplied coefficients
     would produce the correct output image component samples, at their
     declared bit-depths, if applied to codestream image components which
     are also expressed at their declared bit-depths. */

         objects, which describe the inverse multi-component transform for
         a particular tile, identified by the `tile_num' argument.  The list
         of MCT stages is created from the descriptions found in the
         coding parameter sub-system, whose root is given by `params_root'.
         The remaining arguments describe the input and output image
         components associated with the transform.  The contents of these
         arrays are not modified, but they are used to contribute to the
         initialization of the stage contents.  Note that the
         `kd_output_comp_info::ref_subsampling' member of the
         `output_component_info' array is ignored by this function.  The
         caller may later use the corresponding member of the internal
         `output_comp_info' member array to check for dimensional
         consistency with the corresponding global value.
            The head and tail of the created list are both returned via
         `result_head' and `result_tail'.  A number of conditions could
         cause this function to fail through `kdu_error'.  In many
         applications this causes an exception to be thrown, after
         which any partially created list of transform stages should be
         cleaned up.  The easiest way to do this is for the function to
         grow the list inside an object which will persist beyond any
         such exception -- in practice, this is the `kd_codestream' or
         `kd_tile' object, both of which maintain head/tail member
         variables for MCT stage lists.
            If `tile_num' is negative, this function is being used to create
         the `global_mct_head' & `global_mct_tail' members of
         `kd_codestream' based only on information in the main codestream
         header.  Strictly speaking, it is possible that insufficient
         marker segments might be found in the main header to do this
         successfully in a legal Part 2 codestream.  However, without
         this information it is not possible to know the dimensions of
         the output components ahead of time, which is an accidental oversight
         by the committee which defined JPEG2000 Part2.  For this reason,
         we shall treat such codestreams as illegal, but we shall not
         insist that any of the transform coefficients (linear coefficients
         or offsets) be available from the main codestream header; only
         the structure is required (MCO and MCT marker segments).  In
         particular, this means that the present function leaves all but
         the first 6 member fields of each `kd_mct_block' equal to 0
         (i.e., as if each transform block was a null transform) when
         invoked with a negative `tile_num' argument. */

  /* Notes:
       Each stage of the multi-component transform has a well-defined
     contiguous set of input and output components, even if not all of the
     components in this range are fully used or defined.  The stages appear
     in the order required for inverse transformation (synthesis) during
     decompression.  For this reason, the first `num_inputs'
     member for the first MCT stage is guaranteed to be equal to the
     number of codestream image components.
        In order to satisfy the constraints described by IS 15444-2,
     the `num_inputs' value of any one stage must not be less
     than the `num_outputs' value of the previous stage.  Also,
     every one of the `num_inputs' must be "touched" by one or
     another MCT block.  However, not all of the `num_outputs'
     need to be explicitly generated by any MCT block.  Those which are
     not are known as NULL components -- they are defined to be identically
     equal to 0.
        Once the list of stages has been created, the `num_outputs' value
     from one stage is augmented (if necessary) to the `num_inputs' value
     of the next stage.  This is done only to simplify the way in which
     stages are manipulated.
        The `input_required_indices' array contains one entry for each
     of the input components.  The k'th entry is non-negative if and only
     if input component k is "required", meaning that it contributes to at
     least one of the output components which are apparent and of interest
     to the application, as identified by the
     `kd_output_comp_info::is_of_interest' values in the
     `output_comp_info' array.  Moreover, non-negative indices in the
     `input_required_indices' array identify the ordinal position
     occupied by the corresponding component, in the set of all required
     components.  For non-initial stages, this ordinal position is the same
     as the apparent index of the previous stage's output component.
        It may not always be easy (or expedient) to determine
     precisely whether an input component actually contributes to the
     output produced by a transform block, so it is possible that the
     set of input components which are marked as "required" contains
     some components which could potentially be ignored.  Nevertheless,
     reasonable efforts are made to limit the set of required input
     components, based on the set of required output components.
        The `num_required_inputs' member holds the total number of
     non-negative entries in the `input_required_indices' array.
        The `prev_stage' member is NULL if this is the first stage in
     the inverse (synthesis) multi-component transform, meaning that the
     stage's input components are the codestream image components.
        The `next_stage' member is NULL if this is the last stage in the
     inverse (synthesis) multi-component transform, meaning that the stage's
     output components are the final output image components produced by
     the decompression process. */

      /* This function plays a critical role in rate control and preparing
         for code-stream generation.  It may be used in applications which
         generate the entire code-stream once all precinct data has been
         generated, but it may also be used in applications which generate
         the code-stream incrementally, periodically sizing and generating
         whatever portion of the code-stream can be written, given the
         code-blocks which have been encoded so far.
            To understand the operation of this function, it is helpful to
         know that whenever a precinct's code-blocks have been encoded, the
         precinct is entered onto a "ready" list.  When the present function
         is called, it simulates the process of generating final code-stream
         output for a single quality layer of all such "ready" precincts.
         If the "ready" precincts are not sufficient to generate the
         full code-stream, their size is automatically scaled, using an
         algorithm which attempts to estimate the number of bytes which
         would be occupied by all packets belonging to the indicated layer
         which have not yet been written to the code-stream.  For this reason,
         the `max_bytes' value supplied to this function should represent
         the maximum number of bytes which are allowed for all packets
         belonging to the indicated layer, minus the number of bytes which
         have already been written for packets belonging to that layer.
            The simulation process is driven by the supplied distortion-length
         slope threshold.  A slope threshold of 0 yields the largest possible
         output size and 0xFFFF yielding the smallest possible output size
         (all code-block bytes discarded).
            The number of bytes returned includes the cost of packet headers,
         which is also returned separately via the `packet_header_bytes'
         argument.  Both the return value and the `packet_header_bytes' value
         are scaled to represent the expected cost over all packets of the
         indicated layer which have not yet been written to the code-stream.
         Moreover, if `layer_idx'=0, the number of returned bytes also
         includes the value returned by the `get_main_and_tile_header_cost'
         function.
            The `layer_idx' and `reslength_layer_idx' arguments will normally
         be identical.  The former indicates the number of layers which have
         already been finalized (if 0, the tag-tree coding machinery must
         be initialized in each packet) -- this is the value passed to
         `kd_precinct::simulate_packet'.  The latter value is passed to
         `kd_reslength_checker::set_layer' if appropriate.  The two values
         may differ only when `pcrd_opt' is obtaining a preliminary
         distortion-length slope threshold for a quality layer that has a
         target size, in order to assign distortion-length slope thresholds
         to earlier unsized layers (ones that have 0 for their target length,
         meaning that they are to be implicitly sized).
            The `finalize_layer' argument should be true if this is the last
         call to this function with the current layer index.  This causes the
         packet header state information to be saved to a place from which
         it will be restored in each simulation attempt for the next layer.
         Also, it is mandatory to finalize the layers during simulation
         before actually generating packet data.
            The `last_layer' argument should be true if this is the final
         layer for which any information will be generated.  If any tile
         contains more layers, their contribution will be included at this
         point as empty packets (i.e., the empty packet bit is set to 0).
         Any such empty packet is never assigned an SOP marker.
            The `max_bytes' argument may be used to supply an upper bound on
         the total number of bytes which are allowed to be generated here.
         This allows the simulation process to stop as soon as this limit
         is exceeded.  In this case, the returned byte count may not be a
         true reflection of the full cost of generating the layer, but it
         is guaranteed to exceed the `max_bytes' limit.
            When the function is called with `finalize_layer' true, the
         `max_bytes' limit must not, under any circumstances be exceeded.
         The assumption is that the caller has already done the work of
         figuring out a slope threshold which will satisfy the relevant
         rate constraint -- if not, `max_bytes' can be set to
         KDU_LONG_HUGE (the default).  Note that KDU_LONG_HUGE is a
         very large "kdu_long" value which can be represented exactly as a
         double precision floating point quantity; it may be less than
         KDU_LONG_MAX.
            A non-NULL `sloppy_bytes' argument may be supplied only when
         finalizing the last layer, once all code-blocks in the entire
         code-stream have been generated.  In this case, the caller must be
         certain that a slope threshold of `slope_threshold'+1 can satisfy
         the limit imposed by `max_bytes'.  The function first runs the low
         level packet-oriented simulation tools with this value of
         `slope_threshold'+1 and then runs them again (this time finalizing)
         with `slope_threshold'.  On the second run, any additional coding
         passes which would be contributed due to the reduced threshold are
         trimmed away from the relevant code-blocks (they cannot be recovered
         later on) until the number of additional bytes is less than the value
         of *`sloppy_bytes'.  The *`sloppy_bytes' is progressively decremented,
         so that upon return the caller may determine the total number of
         available bytes which could not be used up.  The caller should then
         generate packet data using the supplied slope threshold.
            This `sloppy_bytes' option slows down the rate control process and
         is recommended primarily when you can expect quite a few code-block
         passes to have the same length-distortion slope value.  This happens
         during transcoding, where the only slope information available comes
         from the indices of the quality layers to which the coding passes
         originally contributed.  It may also happen if the block encoder
         does not collect a rich set of length-distortion statistics, simply
         estimating a rough prioritization instead. */

      /* This function does most of the work of `pcrd_opt'.  The purpose
         of the function is to find a distortion-length slope threshold
         such that the total number of bytes allocated to the quality layer
         identified by `layer_idx' and the preceding `unsized_layers' will
         lie between `min_bytes' and `max_bytes'.
            The `min_bytes' and `max_bytes' thresholds refer to the
         total number of bytes that will be occupied by the relevant packets
         of all outstanding precincts (those not flushed already).  If
         `layer_idx' plus any `unsized_layers' include layer 0, the `min_bytes'
         and `max_bytes' thresholds also include main and tile-part header
         costs, but not the EOC marker cost.
            Upon entry, it is assumed that quality layer
         `layer_idx'-`unsized_layers'-1 has been finalized -- i.e.,
         `simulate_output' has been called for that layer with
         `finalize_layer' equal to true.
            If `unsized_layers' is non-zero, the function is being used to
         form an initial estimate for the threshold to be used with quality
         layer `layer_idx' so that the earlier "unsized layers" can be assigned
         intermediate thresholds.  This estimate does not need to be highly
         accurate and indeed the `min_bytes' threshold might be violated
         if we were to actually use the returned threshold with quality layer
         `layer_idx', but we are only using the return value to assign
         thresholds for the earlier `unsized_layers'.  The challenge here is
         to avoid a situation in which the headers associated with the
         JPEG2000 packets generated for unsized layers prevent us from
         satisfying the `max_bytes' limit once all the unsized layers have
         been finalized and we call the function again with `unsized_layers'
         equal to 0.  To this end, the function conservatively assumes that
         the header sizes for each packet associated with an unsized layer
         will be identical to the header size that would be required if
         there were no unsized layers -- this is conservative because the
         header cost tends to be distributed between the layers to a
         certain extent.
            If `unsized_layers' is 0, the `min_bytes' and `max_bytes' values
         are usually chosen based on the tolerance parameter supplied to
         `pcrd_opt'.  The function is called once in this way for each
         sized quality layer -- i.e., each quality layer for which there is
         a non-zero target size in the `target_sizes' array -- after any
         unsized quality layers are finalized.
            If no quality layers have yet been finalized, the value of
         `max_threshold' is 0xFFFF and `max_threshold_cumulative_bytes' is 0.
         Otherwise,  `max_threshold' holds the slope threshold associated
         with the last finalized layer and `max_threshold_cumulative_bytes'
         represents the cumulative number of bytes occupied (or expected to be
         occupied) by all outstanding precincts (the ones being sized here)
         in all finalized quality layers.  This value is used by the internal
         threshold prediction algorithm, which expects an approximately
         log-linear relationship between the cumulative byte count and the
         slope threshold.
            The `suggested_initial_threshold' value, if non-zero, provides
         an initial guess that the internal algorithm can use to maximize
         its chance of converging to a suitable slope threshold as quickly
         as possible.
            The `simulated_layer_bytes' argument, if non-NULL, is used to
         return the number of bytes associated with a new quality layer
         that has the returned slope threshold, taken over all outstanding
         precincts.  Returning this value can avoid the need for `pcrd_opt'
         to issue a redundant call to `simulate_output'.  If, for some
         reason, the value is not known and `simulated_layer_bytes' is
         non-NULL, the value of *`simulated_layer_bytes' is set to -1.

    void pcrd_opt(bool trim_to_rate, double tolerance);
      /* Runs the PCRD-opt algorithm to find the slope thresholds for each
         of the `num_sized_layers' quality layers for which an entry appears
         in the `target_sizes', `layer_sizes', `cumulative_sizes' and
         `layer_thresholds' arrays.
            Upon entry, the `layer_thresholds' array's entries are either 0
         or else they are equal to the layer thresholds that were discovered
         by a previous flush cycle.  Upon return, the `layer_thresholds' array
         holds the distortion-length slope thresholds for each quality layer,
         which are found to meet the objectives found in the `target_sizes'
         array.
            The `target_sizes' array's entries are not altered in any way
         by this function.  However, non-zero entries are copied across
         directly to the `expected_sizes' array, while the `expected_sizes'
         associated with zero-valued entries in the `target_sizes' array are
         estimated (the estimates are exact in the case where the
         codestream is being flushed all at once, rather than incrementally).
         The following principles are used to drive the rate control process
         for quality layers that do not have explicit target sizes (i.e.,
         where the `target_sizes' entry is zero):
         1) The logarithmic distortion-length slope thresholds associated with
            unsized quality layers should be distributed roughly equally
            between those found for sized quality layers.  This policy
            tends to distribute the associated quality layer sizes roughly
            logarithmically.
         2) If the last quality layer has an unknown size, all remaining
            coded data will be included in that layer and its entry in the
            `target_sizes' array will be set equal to the actual cumulative
            number of bytes allocated to all quality layers.  The second
            last quality layer, if unsized, will then be assigned a target
            size based on the logarithmic distribution rule.
         3) If one or more initial layers have an unknown target size, their
            logarithmic distortion-length slope thresholds will be separated
            from each other by 300.  This often leads to cumulative layer
            sizes that are separated from each other by roughly a factor of
            sqrt(2).
               The function is designed to work under both single flush and
         incremental flushing conditions.  When incremental flushing is used,
         the function will be called multiple times.  Each call determines a
         suitable set of slope thresholds for incremental code-stream, after
         which the caller performs the incremental code-stream generation.
         This latter activity updates entries in the `layer_sizes' array,
         which keeps track of the total size of each quality layer, excluding
         optional pointer information.  The `target_sizes' values refer to
         the cumulative size at each layer, spread over the entire code-stream.
         The present function finds slope thresholds which, if applied to
         all code-blocks not yet written to the code-stream, would be expected
         to produce a number of bytes equal to the relevant `target_sizes'
         value minus the corresponding `layer_sizes' value.
               The `trim_to_rate' argument has the same interpretation as it
         does in the `kdu_codestream::flush' function.  You should not use this
         option unless all code-blocks have already been encoded, meaning that
         this is the last call to this function prior to complete generation
         of the code-stream.
               The `tolerance' argument also has the same interpretation as it
         does in the `kdu_codestream::flush' function.  There is no restriction
         on its use.

    void pcrd_trim(bool finalize_last_layer);
      /* This function is invoked if rate control is driven by fixed
         distortion-length slope targets, but the slope thresholds may need
         to be modified to accommodate an upper bound induced by `Creslengths'
         attributes and/or a lower bound established by the `min_target_sizes'
         array.  On entry, the `layer_thresholds' array contains the slope
         thresholds that are supposed to be used in the absence of
         constraint violations.  On exit, the values in this array may have
         been modified to accommodate the constraints and the `expected_sizes'
         array's entries have been filled out to reflect the expected
         cumulative number of bytes associated with each successive quality
         layer that will result from these slope thresholds.
            When incremental codestream flushing is being employed, the values
         written to the `expected_sizes' array reflect what we expect to
         happen by the time the codestream has been completely flushed,
         although of course these estimates may be quite inaccurate if there
         are significant statistical variations between what has already been
         compressed and what remains to be compressed.
            If `finalize_last_layer' is false, the function need not perform
         a finalizing call to `simulate_output' for the last quality layer;
         this will only be the case when the compressed data target is a
         structured cache, in which case the `cache_write_ready_precincts'
         function will generate all the layer sizes from scratch. */

         work; in this case, the EOC marker is also written.
         Returns false otherwise.
            The contents of each quality layer are determined from the
         distortion-length slope thresholds recorded in the `layer_thresholds'
         member array.  The number of available thresholds must not be less
         than `max_layers'.  If `max_layers' is less than the number of actual
         quality layers in any tile, the additional quality layers will all
         be assigned empty packets.
            The "prcd_opt" member function may be used first to find
         distortion-length slope thresholds for the various quality layers.
         In any event, some simulation must have been performed to set up the
         packet size information required to determine tile-part header sizes,
         which are required for writing SOT marker segments.  This function
         always creates at least one new tile-part for every tile.  If
         requested, PLT marker segments are written into the tile-part headers

         also updates the `layer_sizes' array and fills in final values for
         the `kd_precinct::packet_bytes' array.  Along the way, the present
         function also works out the expected number of bytes associated with
         each quality layer and writes these values into the `expected_sizes'
         array; if the codestream is being flushed incrementally, these
         expected sizes will be estimates only, but if this function completes
         the writing of all outstanding precincts, the `expected_sizes'
         should agree with the `layer_sizes' (after the writing of any
         outstanding codestream headers).  Essentially, the values written to
         `expected_sizes' are identical to those that would be determined
         by a sequence of calls to `simulate_output' (one for each quality
         layer); in some cases, `simulate_output' will have been used to
         determine the `layer_thresholds', but it is often possible to skip
         some or even all of these simulation steps when the compressed data
         target is a structured cache.

  /* Notes:
         The first entry of the `buf_servers' array points to a global
     code buffer server that is used in single-threaded deployment or
     from within a `KD_THREADLOCK_GENERAL' protected critical section in
     multi-threaded applications.  There are `KDU_MAX_THREADS' additional
     elements, providing individual code buffer servers for each thread which
     is associated with the object.  The number of threads is monitored by
     the `thread_context' object, which receives notification of new
     threads from any thread group to which we may belong.  Code buffer
     servers for these extra threads are initialized and attached to the
     `buf_master' object only as required.
         The `rate_stats' array also has 1+`KDU_NUM_THREADS' objects; this
     allows each thread to separately update code-block statistics,
     occasionally passing this information along to the first object which
     holds global code-block R-D statistics.  The `rate_stats[0]' entry is
     NULL unless rate allocation is being used.
         The `num_tparts_used' count does not include tiles which we skipped
     over since they had no intersection with the region of interest.
         The `active_tile' member is used during code-stream parsing to keep
     track of the tile whose tile-part is being actively parsed.  If
     `cached_source' is true, the compressed data is managed by a cache and
     there is no parsing as such.  In this case, `active_tile' is always NULL
     and `tpart_ptr_server' should remain NULL.
         The `global_rescomps' array contains 33*num_components entries.
     The entry at location d*num_components+c is used to manage precincts
     which are ready for rate-control simulation, belonging to component c
     at resolution depth d.  Depth 0 corresponds to the highest resolution
     level of each tile of component c.
         Information is maintained for two different types of image
     components here.  Most of the machinery is concerned with so-called
     "codestream image components".  These are the ones which are subjected
     to spatial DWT, quantization and block coding processes.  Consequently,
     we commonly refer to these simply as the components.  The image
     components, however, are often subjected to subsequent inverse
     colour or multi-component transformation processes in order to
     reconstruct a final image.  We refer to the components (or planes) of
     the final reconstructed image as "output image components".  The
     output components are described by the `num_output_components',
     `num_apparent_output_components' and `output_comp_info' members.
         As discussed extensively in the comments appearing with the second
     form of the `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' function, the
     set of visible (or apparent) output components may be different to
     the set of visible (or apparent) codestream components.  In fact, only
     one of these two sets of components may be restricted at any given
     time, depending on the state of the `component_access_mode' member.
        If `component_access_mode' is set to `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS',
     the set of codestream components may be restricted or permuted via the
     `num_apparent_components' member, working in conjunction with
     `kd_comp_info::apparent_idx' and `kd_comp_info::from_apparent'.  In this
     case, however, information about output components will not be made
     available over the API -- output components will be treated as synonymous
     with codestream components.
        If `component_access_mode' is set to `KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS', the
     set of output components may be restricted or permuted via the
     `num_apparent_output_components' member, working in conjunction with
     `kd_output_comp_info::apparent_idx' and
     `kd_output_comp_info::from_apparent'.  In this case, all codestream
     components are visible across the API in their original form, except
     that applications will not be able to access a non-empty
     `kdu_tile_comp' interface for any tile-component which is not
     involved in the reconstruction of any visible output components within
     the relevant tile (this may vary from tile to tile). */

  /* Notes:
        The `max_relevant_layers' member indicates the maximum number of
     layers from the current tile which can ever be relevant to the
     application.  It holds the same value as `num_layers', unless the
     code-stream was created for reading and is non-persistent, in which
     case it holds the value of `num_apparent_layers'.  This member is used
     to avoid parsing any more packets than we have to when reading
     non-persistent code-streams.
        The `max_relevant_packets' member is equal to the total number of
     packets in the tile, unless the code-stream was created for reading,
     is non-persistent, and `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' has
     been used to reduce the spatial region of interest, or to identify one
     or more resolutions, components or layers as irrelevant to the
     application.  In that case it holds the product of the number of the
     `max_relevant_layers' value and the number of precincts which are
     actually relevant to the identify spatial region, resolution and
     components.
        Similarly, `sequenced_relevant_packets' counts the number of packets
     which have been sequenced (either written or read, as appropriate) so
     far, skipping only those packets which are deemed to be irrelevant to
     the application.  As for `max_relevant_packets', all packets are
     considered relevant if the code-stream was not created for reading, or
     if the code-stream is persistent, regardless of any calls to
     `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions'.  When this value reaches
     the value of `max_relevant_packets', there is no need to parse any
     further contents from the tile.
        If `skipping_to_sop' is true, packets are automatically discarded
     (this is a pseudo-transfer which leaves the packet empty) until one is
     reached whose packet number agrees with the value of
     `next_sop_sequence_num'.  To assist this operation, the
     `next_input_packet_num' counter keeps track of the zero-based index
     of the next packet to be parsed.  Note that we need a separate counter,
     in addition to `sequenced_relevant_packets', since not all packets
     which are parsed need necessarily be relevant to the application.
        A tile is said to be "unloadable" once the following conditions have
     been satisfied:
     1) the codestream is in persistent mode;
     2) the compressed data source is seekable or a cache;
     3) this tile is not currently open;
     4) this tile is not the one referenced by `kd_codestream::active';
     Such tiles are enterered on a list managed by the `unloadable_next'
     and `unloadable_prev' members, and have their `is_unloadable' flag set
     to true.  When an unloadable tile is deleted, the corresponding
     `kd_tile_ref::tile' entry is set to NULL rather than `KD_EXPIRED_TILE'.
     This ensures that the tile can be re-parsed from the compressed data
     source if required again at a later point.  Tiles on the unloadable
     list may be deleted automatically, according to a tile memory management
     policy.
        A tile is said to be "addressable" if the following conditions hold:
     1) the codestream is in input (reading) mode;
     2) the compressed data source is not a cache;
     3) the compressed data source is seekable; and
     4) the current tile-part contains usable precinct pointer information.
     Such tiles are identified by the `is_addressable' flag.  This flag is
     set on each call to `read_tile_part_header'.  All that actually
     matters is that we correctly identify when the codestream has an
     active tile which is not addressable; in that case, the tile's
     packets must be desequenced up until the end of the tile-part before
     any seeking on the compressed data source can be allowed.
        A tile is said to be "in-progress" if the following conditions
     apply:
     1) the codestream was created for output;
     2) the tile has already been opened -- it may or may not have been closed;
     3) the tile's contents have not yet been fully flushed to the codestream.
     In-progress tiles are entered onto a doubly-linked list managed by the
     `in_progress_next' and `in_progress_prev' pointers.  The head and
     tail of this list are managed by `kd_codestream::tiles_in_progress_head'
     and `kd_codestream::tiles_in_progress_tail'. */

  /* Notes:
        `recommended_extra_bits' may be added to the sample bit-depth
     (precision) for this component to determine an appropriate number
     of bits for internal representations associated with the data
     processing path.
        In the reversible path, the value is set to the maximum bit-depth
     expansion factor, as reported in Table 17.4 of the book by Taubman and
     Marcellin, adding an extra 1 bit if the RCT has been used -- note that it
     is not desirable for luminance and chrominance components to have
     different numeric representations, since that would significantly
     complicate the colour transform procedure.
        In the irreversible path, the value is set to 7, which means
     that 16-bit representations are judged sufficient for 9 bit
     imagery or less.  Of course, the impact of selecting a reduced
     representation precision is only reduced accuracy in the
     irreversible processing path.
        The `enabled' flag is used to efficiently identify the tile-components
     which are enabled.  Remember that a tile-component may be disabled,
     either because the corresponding codestream image component is not
     apparent (only when the `kd_codestream::component_access_mode' is
     `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS'), or because the tile-component
     is not involved in the construction of an apparent output image
     component (when the `kd_codestream::component_access_mode' is
     `KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS').  In the latter case, all codestream
     image components are apparent, but disabled ones cannot be
     accessed -- this is important, since in the latter case the set
     of enabled components may vary from tile to tile.
        The `is_of_interest' flag is used to store the identify of components
     which are marked as being of interest, by calls to
     `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'.  This is done only when the
     component access mode is `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS' or the
     `mct_head' member is NULL.  Otherwise, the components of interest are
     passed directly to the `kd_mct_stage::apply_output_restrictions'
     function.  Note that the `is_of_interest' flags do not generally
     belong to the component in which they are stored.  They are just
     copies of the information supplied to
     `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest', without any attempt to apply
     any component index permutations which might be relevant. */

         `pos_idx' holds the horizontal and vertical position of the
         precinct (starting from 0) within the array of precincts for
         the given resolution.  That is, `pos_idx' holds a relative, not
         an absolute precinct index.
            If the precinct is known to be unloadable (this happens if the
         precinct has previously been opened and has then been permanently
         closed), the function returns NULL.
            If the precinct currently exists in memory (the `state' variable
         contains a valid pointer to the precinct), the function returns a
         pointer to that precinct; however, if `need_activate' is true
         and the precincts's `released' flag is true, `kd_precinct::activate'
         is called before returning the `kd_precinct' pointer.  When the
         codestream object was created for input or for interchange, the
         `need_activate' argument should be set to true only when the
         precinct is being opened in order to access code-block data.  In
         that case, the precinct must belong to an open tile and lie within
         the application's current region of interest, meaning that it will
         be released again when the tile is closed.  For codestream objects
         created for output, the argument should have no effect, since
         output precincts are not actually released.
            Otherwise, the function obtains a new `kd_precinct' object from
         the code-stream's precinct server and calls its `initialize'
         function.  If the `state' variable held the precinct's unique
         address value on entry, that address is written into the newly
         instantiated `kd_precinct' object's `unique_address' field, and
         the P bit (see notes on `state' below) is copied to the precinct's
         KD_PFLAG_WAS_READ flag. If compressed data comes from a cached source,
         or the codestream object was created for interchange (no compressed
         data sources or targets), the newly created precinct is automatically
         marked as addressable, with its `unique_address' set to the
         precinct's unique identifier, as described in the comments appearing
         with the declaration of `kd_precinct::unique_address'.  For
         precincts which can be addressed using a seek address (for seekable
         compressed data sources), the seek address is installed using
         `set_address' from within the `kd_packet_sequencer::next_in_sequence'
         function.
            It is worth noting that this function may cause other precincts
         to be unloaded from memory, in order to conserve memory resources.
         If this happens, only precincts which have been released and
         which do not intersect with the current region of interest will be

         order to desequence a new packet.  Opening precincts can be a time
         consuming task, especially when there are an enormous number of
         precincts (this can happen when working with huge untiled images,
         especially in geospatial applications).  This function takes
         advantage of the fact that there is no need to actually open a
         precinct which is not already loaded into memory.  The fact that this
         function is called first by the packet desequencer, allows a precinct
         which has already been fully generated to be closed immediately
         during packet generation mode.
            The function works as follows.  If the precinct is already loaded
         in memory, its `sequenced' flag is accessed directly.   Otherwise,
         if the reference `state' variable identifies a valid unique
         address for the precinct, it is known to be addressable and
         therefore must have already been fully desequenced.  Also, if the
         `state' variable indicates that the precinct is unloadable, or that
         it has been closed in packet generation mode, it is interpreted as
         sequenced, in the sense that the application cannot sequence further
         packets for the precinct.  Otherwise, the `state' variable must hold
         0 (see below), from which we deduce that the precinct has not yet
         been sequenced. */

        This structure is the base of the richer `kd_node' structure.  The

        The `branch_x' and `branch_y' members describe how this node is
     derived from its parent node, if any.  `branch_x' holds 0 if horizontal
     low-pass filtering and decimation were used to obtain the node from its

  /* Notes:
        This object is used to construct descriptions of all non-leaf
     nodes in the DWT decomposition structure.  Each node in the structure
     may be decomposed horizontally, vertically or both.  If it is decomposed
     in the horizontal direction, `children[HL_BAND]' will be non-NULL.  If it
     is decomposed in the vertical direction, `children[LH_BAND]' will be
     non-NULL.  If it is decomposed in both directions, `children[HH_BAND]'
     will also be non-NULL.  If it is decomposed at all, `children[LL_BAND]'
     will always be non-NULL.
        The decomposition structure consists of a collection of primary
     nodes, each of which is embedded within a `kd_resolution' object.
     In the case of the simple Mallat structure, each primary node has
     4 children, with the LL child embedded within the next lower
     resolution object and the remaining children embedded within
     `kd_subband' objects.  In wavelet packet decomposition structures,
     detail subbands produced by a primary node may, themselves, be
     decomposed further into subbands.
        The actual object pointed to by each non-NULL member of the `children'
     array may need to be cast to type `kd_node', rather than `kd_leaf_node'
     if the `kd_leaf_node::is_leaf' member is false.
        The `children[LL_BAND]' entry of a primary node always points to
     the node which is embedded within the next lower resolution
     `kd_resolution' object, except at the lowest resolution of all.
     The lowest `kd_resolution' object's embedded node has only one
     child, with `children[LL_BAND]' pointing to the single (LL) subband
     belonging to that resolution.
        The `num_hor_steps' and `num_vert_steps' members identify the number
     of horizontal and vertical lifting steps associated with the horizontal
     and vertical transform operations applied at this node to produce its
     children.  One or both of these may be 0, either because the transform
     is trivial (lazy wavelet) or because the node is split only in the
     horizontal direction, only in the vertical direction, or is not split
     at all.
        The `num_descendant_nodes' member holds a count of the total number
     of nodes (leaf nodes and non-leaf nodes) which may be reached via the
     `children' array.  The `num_descendant_leaves' member holds a count of
     the number of these descendant nodes which are leaves.  Neither of these
     counts includes the current node.  Clearly there is no need to
     maintain this information with leaf nodes, since the counts would both
     be 0 in this case.
        The `bibo_gains' member point to an array with
     2+`num_hor_steps'+`num_vert_steps' entries.  The first 1+`num_hor_steps'
     entries describe BIBO gains for the horizontal transform performed
     at this node.  The remaining `num_vert_steps' entries describe BIBO
     gains for the vertical transform performed at this node.  Within each
     of these 2 sets of BIBO gains the first entry holds the BIBO gain from
     the original input image to the image which is presented at the input
     to this node.  Subsequent entries hold the BIBO gains from the original
     input image to the image which is presented at the output of each
     successive analysis lifting step.  All BIBO gains are assessed relative to
     the nominal transform normalization, in which reversible lifting steps
     are applied as-is, while irreversible lifting steps are followed by the
     relevant `kd_tile_comp::low_scale' and `kd_tile_comp::high_scale' values.
        The interpretation of `region_cover' is similar to that of
     `kd_leaf_node::region', with a subtle, yet important twist.  In order to
     reconstruct each sample in `region', it is necessary to decode a
     particular set of samples from the subbands which are associated with
     this node.  Each of these subband samples has a mapping onto the
     coordinate system associated with the node, following the usual rules of
     the canvas coordinate system.  `res_cover' holds the smallest region
     which contains all of these mapped subband sample locations, except that
     the LL subband branch is included only if this is not a primary node.
     This ensures that the primary node embedded inside each `kd_resolution'
     object will have a `region_cover' which spans the nominal locations of
     all subband samples of interest, which are represented by codestream
     packets associated with that resolution. */

  /* Notes:
        It may come as a surprise to notice that this object has no
     direct connection to code-blocks.  To access a code-block, the object
     first determines the precinct to which it belongs, creating that
     precinct if necessary; this, in turn, creates its precinct-bands and
     the associated code-blocks.  In this way, no memory whatsoever need be
     dedicated to code-blocks which lie in unaccessed precincts.
        The `notify_queue', `bkgnd_state' and `pending_bkgnd_state' members
     are used to implement `kdu_subband::attach_block_notifier' and
     `kdu_subband::advance_rows_needed'.  The `pending_bkgnd_state' is
     adjusted only from within the background processing job, apart from
     being reset during tile initialization and close events.  Each time
     `kd_resolution::advance_available_precinct_rows' is called, it
     propagates the impact of newly available precinct "rows" to the
     individual subbands, incrementing `pending_bkgnd_state' by the number
     of newly available code-block "rows" and setting the MSB of this
     member variable if all code-block rows are available.
        The `bkgnd_state' member has the form S+4*R, where S is a 2-bit state
     variable and R is the "required rows" accumulator.  Specifically,
     -- S=0 means that the `notify_queue' is either not valid or not
        "live" in the sense discussed in the comments following
        `kd_resolution'.  Not being live means that the final notification
        message has been delivered to the queue or is about to be delivered
        once the background thread gets around to it.
     -- S=1 means that the `notify_queue' is live; this state is set up by
        `kdu_subband::attach_block_notifier' and remains until the
        `kdu_subband::detach_block_notifier' function is called, or the
        final notification message is delivered to the `notify_queue'.
     -- S=2 means that the `kdu_subband::detach_block_notifier' function
        has been called, requesting premature detachment of a `notify_queue'
        that was live at the time.  The actual detachment will not be
        completed until a special notification message is delivered from
        within the `kd_resolution::do_background_processing' function.
     -- S=3 is a reserved value that currently has no meaning and should
        never occur.
     -- The value of R is equal to `max_Rp' - `Rp', where `max_Rp' is the sum
        of the `delta_rows_needed' values passed to
        `kdu_subband::advance_block_rows_needed' and `Rp' is the number of
        code-block "rows" that the `notify_queue' should be allowed to
        "consider" available.  Those code-block "rows" that are available but
        cannot yet be considered available are stored in `pending_bkgnd_state',
        as mentioned above.  Currently, our policy is to decrement R
        (increment Rp) by 1 and decrement `pending_bkgnd_state' by 1, so long
        as this leaves R >= 0 and (`pending_bkgnd_state' & 0x7FFFFFFF) >= 0,
        each time a subband is serviced, scheduling a future service event
        if R and `pending_bkgnd_state' & 0x7FFFFFFF both still have non-zero
        values.
     Note that in the above, by "rows" we actually mean whole rows of
     code-blocks as seen from the `kdu_subband' interface.  If the
     `kdu_codestream::change_appearance' function has been used to set a
     transposed geometry, these are actually columns.  Similarly, if the
     relevant dimension has been flipped, these rows are measured from the
     bottom (resp. right) rather than the top (resp. left) of the subband. */

         increments an internal count of the number of threads that are
         blocking new calls to `do_background_processing' from doing anything.
         On entry, if a `do_background_processing' call finds that there are
         one or more blockers, it returns immediately.  Moreover, if there
         are one or more blockers, `schedule_background_progress' calls
         do not actually schedule any new calls to `do_background_processing',
         although they do update the internal record of the fact that
         background processing is required.  The number of blockers
         is reduced only when `schedule_background_detach' is called.
            The idea is that a thread invokes this function if it is about to
         record a request within some subband for a deferred detachment
         notification, after which it would normally need at the very least
         to check whether or not the object needs to be appended to the
         background service queue in order to ensure that the request gets
         processed and the detachment notification message gets delivered to
         the relevant notify queue.  However, this sequence of operations
         runs the risk that a call to `do_background_processing'
         picks up the detachment notification request and processes it,
         before the thread that recorded it has yet checked whether or not
         the resolution object needs to be appended to the background service
         queue.  This is only a problem if the detachment notification belongs
         to the last live notification queue for the resolution, because it
         could cause a chain of events to be set in progress that will result
         in another thread calling `kdu_tile::close' before the thread that
         requested the notification gets a chance to check whether or not
         the resolution object needs to be appended to the background service
         queue -- testing for such a need alone is dangerous since a call to
         `kdu_tile::close' may have deleted or recycled the memory associated
         with the present object!
            The solution to the above problem is as follows.  The final
         notification message for the last live subband notify queue in the
         resolution is always deferred until a subsequent call to
         `do_background_processing', if another such call has been scheduled
         or if there are any blockers (created by this function).  This
         ensures that this notification call cannot take place at least until
         after the thread that requested the detachment notification invokes
         `schedule_background_detach', which is the last thing that it will
         do before returning. */

         `reserve_background_detach'.  If appropriate, this causes the
         current object to be appended to the background serving queue so
         that processing of the detachment request can be completed.
         Specifically, if the number of blockers reduces to 0 and the object
         is not currently on the background service queue, it is added to
         the queue so that at least one more call to `do_background_processing'

  /* Notes:
        The `current_sequencer_pos' coordinates are used to sequence
     spatially oriented packet progressions.  They maintain the
     indices (starting from [0,0], rather than `precinct_indices.pos')
     of the precinct which is currently being sequenced.
        The `region_indices' member holds the smallest range of precinct
     indices, such that the code-blocks contained within these precincts
     are sufficient to reconstruct all samples inside `node.region'.
     Equivalently, the range in `precinct_indices' yields the set of
     precincts which intersect with `node.region_cover'.
        It is worth noting that the area of intersection between each
     precinct's region on the resolution and the `node.region_cover' region
     is used to compute the information returned by
     `kdu_resolution::get_precinct_relevance'.
        The last five members are used to implement background parsing and
     resource allocation processing.  Firstly, `precinct_rows_available'
     keeps track of the number of precinct "rows" from the range identified
     by `region_indices' that have already been parsed (decompression) or
     allocated (compression) within a background job scheduled from within
     `kd_cs_thread_context'.  The meaning of "rows" here depends upon the
     geometry set by `kdu_codestream::change_appearance'.  In particular, if
     the appearance has been flipped vertically, rows start from the bottom
     and work upwards, if the appearance has been transposed,
     `precinct_rows_available' actually counts whole precinct columns, and
     so forth.  This member variable is used exclusively in the implementation
     of `advance_precinct_rows_available' that is called, as required, from
     within `do_background_processing'.
        The remaining four member variables play a critical role in the
     robust and lock-free interaction between a background processing thread
     that enters `do_background_processing' and the threads that enter
     the `attach_block_notifier', `detach_block_notifier' and
     `advance_block_rows_needed' function's of the resolution's subbands.
     The most critical consideration that underlies the implementation is
     protection against a highly unlikely yet highly insidious race condition
     that could arise through the delivery of notification messages to the
     `kd_subband::notify_queue' objects from within `do_background_processing'.
     Specifically, the concern is that these notification calls will eventually
     leave all the subband encoding/decoding engines in a state where they
     can invoke their `kdu_thread_queue::all_done' functions (usually through
     the scheduling and execution of block encoding/decoding jobs), which
     will eventually allow an application to successfully return from a call
     to `kdu_thread_queue::join' or `kdu_thread_queue::terminate', after
     which it will eventually invoke `kdu_tile::close'; that, in turn, may
     result in the cleaning up (or recycling) of the present `kd_resolution'
     object.  If we are extraorinarily unlucky, all of this could happen
     while the call to `do_background_processing' that set all these events
     in motion is still in progress, potentially accessing member variables
     or setting synchronization state values that are no longer accessible.
        The key to avoiding any such possibility, without having to actually
     create mutexes and lock critical sections, is to keep track of the number
     of "live notify queues" within the interlocked `bkgnd_state' variable.
     Each time a subband's `attach_block_notifier' function is called, the
     number of live queues is incremented.  Each time the last notification
     call is delivered to a notify queue, the count is decremented.  If the
     count is about to go to zero through such a decrementing process, we
     are in danger of creating the above-mentioned race condition.  To avoid
     this, the `bkgnd_state' member contains other fields that keep track of
     whether or not this object has been re-scheduled for background processing
     via a call one of its subband's `advance_block_rows_needed' or
     `detach_block_notifier' functions -- this could happen asynchronously
     while we are visiting the subbands within `do_background_processing'.  If
     we are reduce the number of "live notify queues" to 0 only to discover
     that the `bkgnd_state' value has been modified to reflect
     rescheduling of the current object for background processing, we do
     not immediately invoke the relevant notify queue's `update_dependencies'
     function; instead, we store details of the notification message that
     needs to be posted within the `pending_notify_queue' and
     `pending_p_delta' members of this object; the first thing we do when
     we return to `do_background_processing', after being rescheduled for
     background processing, is check these members to see if there is a
     pending notification message that needs to be sent.  That way, we
     can be guaranteed that the dangerous final notification call can be
     performed at a point when the `kd_resolution' object is not enqueued
     for further background processing; moreover we can return immediately
     from `do_background_processing' immediately after issuing this call,
     so that there is no possibility that we touch any member variables or
     virtual functions within the tile that might henceforth be cleaned up
     or recycled.
        The `bkgnd_next' member is used to build a linked list of
     `kd_resolution' objects that must be visited during background
      processing.
        The `bkgnd_state' member has the following structure, reflected in
     defined macros of the form `KD_RESOLUTION_BKGND_SCHEDULED_...':
     -- S (bit-0) is set when the object is appended to the background
        servicing queue and reset when the `do_background_processing'
        function enters.  Relevant macro: `KD_RESOLUTION_BKGND_SCHEDULED'.
     -- P (bit-1) is set if regular background processing has been requested
        via a call to `append_to_background_service_queue'.  If the
        `do_background_processing' function finds this bit to be reset, it
        need not attempt to advance the set of available precinct rows,
        since only detachment processing is of interest.  Relevant macro:
        `KD_RESOLUTION_BGND_PROGRESS'.
     -- L (bits 2-7) holds a count of the total number of
        "live notify queues", as explained above -- this value will never
        exceed 48 in practice, since that is the maximum number of subbands
        in any given resolution level.  Relevant macros:
        `KD_RESOLUTION_BGND_LIVE_xxx'.
     -- B (all remaining bits) holds count of the number of threads that are
        currently "blocking" calls to `do_background_processing' from being
        scheduled or doing anything.  This count is incremented by calls to
        `reserve_background_detachment' and decremented by calls to
        `schedule_background_detachment'.  Relevant macros:
        `KD_RESOLUTION_BKGND_BLOCKING_xxx'.

  /* Notes:
        This structure has been designed to provide sufficient state
     information for each code-block to perform packet header parsing as
     well as block encoding and decoding.  For coding purposes, the information
     represented by the structure is generally transferred to or from a
     much less tightly packed representation for speed of execution of the
     block coding routines.  As it stands, the total size of this structure
     should be 24 bytes on a 32-bit architecture. An array of code-blocks is
     maintained by each precinct-band.  The array contains one entry for
     every block in the relevant precinct-band, but also contains additional
     entries to be used as tag-tree nodes.  The total number of such extra
     nodes is about 1/3 the number of code-blocks and should not be a
     significant cause of concern for overall memory consumption. There is
     also substantial benefit to be had by locating the tag tree nodes in
     the same contiguous memory block.  Notice that the structure contains
     no reference back to the precinct-band to which it belongs.  When
     necessary, this reference must be supplied separately to interested
     functions. One consequence of this memory saving step is that the
     object's destructor cannot do anything useful.  It only checks to make
     sure that the explicit `cleanup' function has already been called.
        If a block is to be discarded (since it does not intersect with a
     user-specified region of interest), the `num_passes' field will hold
     the otherwise impossible value, 255.
        The `first_buf', `current_buf' and `buf_pos' fields constitute the
     compressed data buffer management mechanism, which is used to store all
     quantities whose length is unpredictable a priori. In particular, a
     linked list of `kd_code_buffer' structures is provided, which grows on
     demand through access to the codestream object's embedded `buffering'
     object.  Data is stored in these buffers in the following formats:
           * Input Format -- [<layer #> (<#bytes> <#passes> ...)] data [<...
             That is, for each layer to which the code-block makes a non-empty
             contribution, we record first the layer number (2 bytes) and
             then one or more #bytes/#passes pairs.  #bytes is represented
             using 2 bytes, while #passes is represented using only 1 byte.
             There is one such 3 byte pair for each layer and one additional
             3 byte pair for each codeword segment terminating pass which
             is not the final pass contributed in the layer.  In this way,
             sufficient information is provided to recover all termination
             lengths, as well as to build layer associations.  The most
             significant bit of the #bytes field is used as a marker to
             indicate whether or not this is the last such field prior to
             the appearance of the code bytes contributed by that layer.  A
             1 means that there are more fields to go before the code bytes
             appear.
           * In-memory Format --[<layer #>(<#bytes> <#passes>...)] <addr> [<...
             This format is used as an alternative to the Input Format above,
             in the special case when the compressed data source supports the
             `KDU_SOURCE_CAP_IN_MEMORY' capability, so that
             `kd_codestream::in_memory_source' is true.  In this case, the
             "data" field is replaced by the address where the data can be
             found in the memory block managed by the compressed data source.
             Moreover, if the number of code-bytes associated with a layer
             is zero, the <addr> field is missing.
           * Output Format -- [<RD slope> <#bytes>] ... [<RD ...] data
             That is, all of the header information for all coding passes
             appears up front, followed by all of the code bytes associated
             with those coding passes.  The reason for putting all the
             header information up front is that it facilitates the
             identification of appropriate layer contributions by the
             rate control algorithm.  Each coding pass has a 4 byte header,
             with 2 bytes for the distortion-length slope value and 2 bytes
             for the number of code-bytes for the pass.
     The particular format which is used to store data depends upon the
     member functions which are used, since these implicitly determine
     whether the codestream object is being used for input or output.
        The `modes' field holds the block coder mode fields.  Some of these
     are required even for correct packet header parsing, regardless of whether
     the block is to be actually decoded.
        `msbs_w' and `msbs_wbar' are the state information required
     for tag-tree coding of the number of missing MSB's for a code-block
     which is about to make its first non-empty contribution to the
     code-stream. Similarly, `layer_w' and `layer_wbar' hold the state
     information required for tag-tree coding of the layer index in which a
     code-block first contributes to the code-stream.  The operation of
     tag-tree coding and the `w' and `wbar' terminology are explained in
     Section 8.4 of the book by Taubman and Marcellin.
        The `beta' field shares storage with `msbs_wbar'.  This is not
     required until the number of missing MSB's has been encoded or decoded,
     at which point we initialize `beta' to 3 (see the JPEG2000 standard or
     Section 12.5.4 of the book by Taubman and Marcellin).  A useful
     consequence of this behaviour is that `beta' may be tested at any
     point of the packet header encoding or decoding process to determine
     whether or not the code-block has yet contributed to the code-stream
     -- the value will be non-zero if and only if it has done so.
        The `num_bytes' field shares storage with `layer_wbar'.  It
     identifies the total number of bytes included by the code-block in
     all packets read or written so far.  The value is taken to be 0 if
     the code-block has not yet contributed to any packets (`beta'=0),
     during which time the `layer_wbar' state variable is in use.
        The `up_down' field is used to efficiently navigate the tag-tree
     structure.  When the tag tree is not actually being navigated, the
     field points up to the current node's parent in the tag tree.  The
     root mode is readily identified by the fact that it has a NULL `up_down'
     pointer. During navigation, the tag-tree coder first walks from a
     leaf node up to the root, modifying the `up_down' pointers as it goes
     so that each successive parent's `up_down' field points bacl down to the
     child from which the parent was reached.  The coder then walks back down
     from the root to the original leaf node, restoring the `up_down' fields to
     their original `up' state. */

         moreover, before returning the function always sets this flag, which
         is only reset by the `release' (unless of course the precinct is
         completely unloaded).
            If the `KD_PFLAG_LOAD_TRUNCATED' flag is found in the `flags'
         member, or if the `num_packets_read' member is greater than or
         equal to `num_required_packets', the function does nothing other
         than to set the `KD_PFLAG_LOADED_LOCKED' flag.  Otherwise, the
         function proceeds in the manner described below.
            As a first step, the function parses through tiles and packets as
         required to recover the location of the precinct and also to make sure
         that any non-addressable tile that is currently being actively parsed
         is not inappropriately interrupted by seeking to the precinct to load
         packets.  During this first step, the precinct will actually be fully
         parsed from the source via calls to `desequence_packets', if it turns
         out to be non-addressable; in this case, we finish up by setting
         the `KD_PFLAG_LOADED_LOCKED' flag and we are done.
            In the event that the precinct is addressable and not all of
         the required packets have been parsed, they are parsed here before
         the `KD_PFLAG_LOADED_LOCKED' flag is set.  To do this, the function
         needs to seek to the start of the precinct's packet stream and parse
         all required packets in from scratch.  In most cases the function
         is working with a precinct whose `num_packets_read' member is zero
         on entry, but if this is not the case, the function first restores
         the precinct to a state in which nothing has been read and the
         `num_read_packets' member is 0, being careful to later invoke
         `read_packet' in such a way that the already parsed packets do not
         contribute to the relevant tile-component's `layer_stats' record.
            Finally, for addressable precincts for which `num_packets_read'
         is 0 (or has been made zero, as described above), the function uses
         the precinct's `unique_address' to position the compressed data
         source at the beginning of the precinct's first packet and then
         load all required packets from the data source.

         Note that packet reading may be interleaved with acesses to the

         representation of the image.  We may then find that the additional

            The function returns false if an SOT marker (or an EOC marker) is

            The `num_prior_packets' member is normally 0.  However, in random
         access applications, if `num_packets_read' was non-zero but more
         packets can potentially be parsed after seeking to the start of the
         precinct's packet data stream, the `reset_packet_reading' function is
         called first which resets the `num_packets_read' member to 0, but
         then `read_packet' is supplied with the previous value of
         `num_packets_read' via its `num_prior_packets' argument.  This value
         is used to ensure that `kd_tile_comp::layer_stats' information is
         only updated for newly parsed packets, whose layer indices are
         greater than or equal to `num_prior_packets'. */

         manipulates the containing tile's `skipping_to_sop' and
         `next_sop_sequence_num' fields, advancing to the next SOP or SOT
         marker if necessary (the function may be called after detecting an
         SOP marker already, whose sequence number is not as expected).  If
         an SOT marker is encountered, the function renders the current tile
         inactive and returns false (this is the behaviour expected of
         `read_packet').  Otherwise, it updates the precinct and tile state to

  /* Notes:
        `unique_address' is valid if and only if the precinct is marked as
     addressable, meaning that the precinct has a unique address from which it
     may be loaded (for input codestream objects) or identified (for
     interchange codestream objects).  If addressable, the `unique_address'
     will be 0 if and only if the precinct is known to be empty, meaning that
     reloading the precinct does not require any actual data transfers from a
     compressed data source.
        Except as described above, when used with seekable compressed data
     sources, the `unique_address' member holds a positive quantity which
     identifies an offset into the code-stream at which the precinct's
     packets may be found.  In the case of cached sources (those advertising
     the KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED capability) or codestream objects created for
     interchange (no compressed data source or target), the `unique_address'
     will be negative and -(1+`unique_address') is the precinct's unique
     identifier, as passed to the `kdu_compressed_source::set_precinct_scope'
     function, or returned by the `kdu_precinct::get_unique_id' function.
        The `num_outstanding_blocks' member is used to monitor the number of
     code-blocks from the application's region of interest which have still
     to be consumed (input codestreams) or the number of code-blocks which
     have still to be written in order to complete the precinct (output
     and interchange codestreams).
        The `next' and `prev' links may be used to manage the precinct's
     location in one of three different lists.  The first list is the
     singly-linked free list maintained by `kd_precinct_size_class', from
     which the `kd_precinct_server' object re-issues previously released
     resources.
        The second list on which this structure may find itself is the
     doubly-linked list of currently inactive precincts, which is managed by
     the `kd_precinct_server' object.  Precincts which find themselves on this
     list have been released, but their resources have not yet been recycled.
     They may be successfully re-activated, if their resources have not been
     re-issued to another precinct.  Precincts on this list may be identified
     by the `inactive' flag.  Every inactive precinct necessarily also has
     its `released' member set to true, but the converse is not necessarily
     true.  This is because precincts which have been partially parsed
     in a context for which they were not directly relevant, will be marked
     as released, even though they are not inactive.
        The third list on which this structure may find itself is the
     doubly-linked list of generated precincts managed by the
     `kd_global_rescomp' structure.  This list contains all precincts
     from a given resolution of a given image component, across all tiles,
     which have been fully generated, but not yet flushed out to the
     code-stream.   The list is used to manage incremental rate allocation
     when processing large images.  Elements on this list have not yet
     been closed. */

  /* Notes:
        This object is used to serve up empty precincts and to recycle their
     storage when they are no longer required.  Precinct memory blocks are
     organized into size classes, based on the maximum number of code-blocks
     and precinct-bands in the precinct, where these quantities are consistent
     for all precincts associated with any given `kd_resolution' object.
     In the event that the `need_packet_bytes_arrays' argument to the
     object's constructor was true, precinct memory blocks also include
     space for the array that holds the number of bytes in each packet of
     the precinct, and the length of this array must also be consistent
     across each size class.
        In many cases, it can happen that all precincts from the entire image
     have exactly the same size class.  This maximizes the potential for
     recycling precinct storage, since precincts may only be allocated from
     and recycled back to their own size class.  The reason for this dependence
     on size classes is that the block of memory associated with each precinct
     is large enough to accommodate all `max_blocks' code-blocks which might
     be required to populate the `kd_precinct_band::blocks' arrays, all
     precinct-bands which are required to populate the `kd_precinct::subbands'
     array, and any storage required for the `kd_precinct::packet_bytes'
     array.  This gets us out of having to maintain separate mechanisms
     to serve up code-block storage as a recyclable resource.  It also helps
     with memory localization.
        The object also manages a cacheing service for precincts and their
     data.  When precincts are released using `kd_precinct_ref::release',
     they are appended to a list of inactive precincts headed by
     `inactive_head' and concluded by `inactive_tail'.  The list is doubly
     linked via the `kd_precinct::next' and `kd_precinct::prev' members.  When
     a previously released precinct is opened using `kd_precinct_ref::open',
     it is removed from this list and its `kd_precinct::activate' function is
     called.  Note that the KD_PFLAG_RELEASED flag is not a reliable
     indicator of whether or not a precinct is on the inactive list, since
     precincts which have been released using `kd_precinct::release', but
     have not yet been completely desequenced (all packets have not yet been
     parsed from or located in the code-stream), will also have this flag
     set, but will not be on an inactive list.  The KD_PFLAG_INACTIVE
     flag should be used to determine whether or not a precinct is on the
     inactive list.
        When `kd_precinct_server::get' function is called, it queries the
     codestream object's `kd_buf_server' service to determine whether or not
     a cache threshold has been exceeded.  If so, it closes down precincts
     on the inactive list until the `kd_buf_server' object reports that
     sufficient resources are in hand. */

     whether the kernel filters are whole-sample-symmetric, whether the
     boundary extension policy is symmetric extension or replication, the
     description of each lifting step, and the set of all lifting step
     coefficients, returning them via the last 6 arguments.  The function
     creates two arrays, returning them via the `step_info' and
     `coefficients' arguments.  In the event that the function fails through
     `kdu_error', most applications will define the behaviour to be that of
     throwing an exception.  In this case, it is important that these
     arguments reference members of a persistent structure which can be
     cleaned up when the exception is handled.  As for the structure of the
     arrays, it is sufficient to note that they can be passed directly to
     the `kdu_kernels::init' function. */
