  /* Notes:
        Each `kd_multi_line' object represents a single intermediate component.
     We describe the flow of information in terms of generators and consumers,
     taking the perspective of the decompressor, since this is the more
     complex case.  During compression, however, the roles of generator
     and consumer are interchanged.
        The line associated with an intermediate component has at most one
     generator, but potentially multiple consumers.  Consumers include
     transform blocks and the application, which is a consumer for
     all final output components.  During decompression, the line cannot be
     advanced until all consumers have finished using its contents -- i.e.,
     until `outstanding_consumers' goes to 0.  When it does, a new line is
     generated, `row_idx' is advanced, and `outstanding_consumers' is reset
     to `num_consumers'.  During compression, the `outstanding_consumers'
     member is not used.  In this case, the `waiting_for_inversion' flag is
     involved -- it is set to true if the row identified by `row_idx' has
     been written by a consumer, but has not yet been used by the transform
     block.
        If `block' is non-NULL, the line is generated by the referenced
     transform block.  Otherwise, the line either corresponds to a
     codestream image component or a constant component (`is_constant' is
     true).  For codestream components, the `collection_idx' identifies the
     index of the entry in the `kd_component_collection::components'
     array within the codestream component collection (maintained by
     `kd_multi_transform') which points to this line.  This is the only
     piece of information required to pull or push a new line to the
     relevant codestream component processing engine.  In all other cases,
     `collection_idx' will be negative.
        If `bypass' is non-NULL, all accesses to this line should be
     treated as accesses to the line identified by `bypass'.  In this
     case, all offsets are collapsed into the line referenced by `bypass'
     so that no arithmetic is required here.  Also, in this case the
     `line' resource remains empty.  `bypass' pointers are found during
     a transform optimization phase; they serve principally to avoid
     line copying when implementing null transforms.
        Note that no line which has `is_constant' set will be bypassed.  Also
     note that all line references found in `kd_multi_block::dependencies'
     or `kd_multi_collection::components' arrays are adjusted to ensure that
     they do not point to lines which have been bypassed -- they always
     point to the lines which actually have the source data of interest.
     This simplifies the processing of data. */

  /* Notes:
        This class manages a single transform block in the multi-component
     transformation process (forwards or backwards).  As with
     `kd_multi_line', the names `generator', `consumer' and `dependency'
     are selected with the decompressor (synthesis) in mind, since this is
     the more complex case.  During compression, the information flows in
     the opposite direction, but the names are not changed (for convenience).
        Each transform block "owns" a set of component lines, as its
     resources.  In most cases, these correspond to the output components,
     which are passed along to the next transform stage, or as final
     decompressed output components.  However, some transform blocks may
     need a larger set of working components than the number of output
     (or even input) components which they produce (or consume).  In any
     event, these owned component lines are described by the `num_components'
     and `components' members.
        The `num_dependencies' and `dependencies' fields identify the
     collection of input lines which are required for this transform block
     to produce output lines (during compression, the roles are reversed,
     so that `dependencies' actually identifies the lines which should be
     filled in when the output lines all become available and are processed;
     as mentioned, though, we describe things here primarily from the
     decompressor's perspective).  The pointers in the `dependencies'
     array refer either to codestream component lines or lines produced as
     outputs by other transform blocks.  It is possible that one or more
     entries in the `dependencies' array contains a NULL pointer.  In this
     case, the input line should be taken to be identically 0 for the
     purpose of performing the transform.
        The `num_available_dependencies' member keeps track of the number of
     initial lines from the `dependencies' array which are already available
     for processing.  During decompression, this means that their
     `kd_multi_line::row_idx' field is equal to the index of the
     next row which needs to be generated by this block.  During compression
     (where the transform block must be inverted), this means that their
     `kd_multi_line::waiting_for_inversion' member is false.  In either case,
     the value of this member must reach `num_dependencies' before a new set
     of lines may be processed by the transform engine.
        The `outstanding_consumers' member holds the sum of the
     `kd_multi_line::outstanding_consumers' members from all lines in the
     `components' array.  This value must reach zero before a new set of
     lines can be processed by the transform engine.
        If `is_null_transform' is true, the transform block does no actual
     processing.  Instead, the first `num_dependencies' of the lines in
     `components' are directly taken from their corresponding dependencies
     and any remaining lines in the `components' array have their
     `is_constant' flag set to true.  In this case, the
     `outstanding_consumers' and `num_available_dependencies' members
     should be ignored. */

  /* Notes:
        The `canvas_min' and `canvas_size' members define the region occupied
     by the complete DWT on its own 1D canvas.  `canvas_low_size' and
     `canvas_high_size' hold the number of low- and high-pass subband samples
     found within this region.
        The `region_min', `region_size', `region_low_size' and
     `region_high_size' members play the same roles as `canvas_min' through
     `canvas_high_size', except for a region of interest within the canvas;
     the region of interest is derived from the set of active image components
     identified by `kdu_tile::get_mct_dwt_info'.
        The `components' array here contains `region_size' pointers into the
     `kd_multi_dwt_block' object's `components' array.
        The `dependencies' array contains `region_size' pointers
     into the `kd_multi_dwt_block' object's `dependencies' array.  NULL
     entries in this array correspond to lines which are derived from the
     next lower DWT stage (during DWT synthesis -- i.e., decompression);
     non-NULL pointers which point to NULL entries in the
     `kd_multi_dwt_block::dependencies' array correspond to lines which must
     be initialized to 0 prior to DWT synthesis; otherwise, the relevant
     dependency (input) is to be copied to the corresponding `components'
     line prior to DWT synthesis at this level.
        The `normalizing_shift' member is the amount to downshift the inputs
     to this level during analysis or upshift the outputs from this level
     during synthesis so as to avoid dynamic range violations during
     fixed-point irreversible processing.
        The `low_range' and `high_range' members identify the amount by which
     low and high subband samples produced at this level (during analysis)
     are scaled, relative to the unit dynamic range that would be expected
     if the DWT were applied using low- and high-pass analysis filters with
     unit pass-band gain, assuming that the input components all have a
     unit dynamic range.  These scaling factors are of interest only when
     working with irreversible transforms, since they affect the amount by
     which samples must be scaled as they are transferred between the
     lines referenced via the `components' and `dependencies' arrays.  These
     range values depart from 1.0 only because we prefer to avoid introducing
     subband gains into each DWT stage. */

         [//]
         Unlike the base implementation, this function manipulates a single
         atomic variable `dstate' that is organized into 3 one-bit flags
         (T, RUN and LLA), a count of the current number of dependencies
         (NUM) and a count of the maximum number of dependencies that could
         occur at any point in the future (MAX).  The base implementation
         keeps only the latter two quantities and stores them in separate
         atomic variables.  The organization of the `dstate' variable is
         governed by macros of the form `KD_MULTI_XFORM_DSTATE_...'.  The
         interpretation of its fields is as follows:
         -- NUM is the D value referred to in the base function's documentation
            (i.e., the number of potentially blocking dependencies formed by
            accumulating the `new_dependencies' arguments encountered in
            calls to this function).  However, positive values of
            `new_dependencies' are temporarily accumulated in the separate
            `acc_new_dependencies' member (non-atomic) and only added back
            into the `dstate' variable after pushing (analysis) or pulling
            (synthesis) a line to/from the DWT analysis/synthesis machinery,
            if the value is found to have increased.
         -- MAX is the M value referred to in the base function's documentation
            (i.e., the maximum number of potentially blocking dependencies
            formed by accumulating the `delta_max_dependencies' arguments
            encountered in calls to this function.
         -- RUN [1 bit] indicates whether or not a DWT processing job is in
            flight.  This flag is used for both multi-threaded (asynchronous)
            and synchronous (`num_stripes'=1) cases to ensure that dependency
            information is not propagated to a parent queue while DWT
            processing is in-flight, since that can garble the sequence of
            update messages received by a parent.  For the asynchronous DWT
            case (`num_stripes' > 1), this bit is set from within the present
            function immediately before scheduling a DWT job and is reset from
            within the relevant DWT job function,
            `kd_multi_job::do_mt_synthesis/analysis'.  For the synchronous
            DWT case (`num_stripes'=1), this bit is set immediately before
            commencing the DWT `push'/`pull' calls and is reset once they
            have completed, at the same point at which the NUM field is
            adjusted to reflect positive dependencies accumulated in
            the non-atomic `acc_new_dependencies' variable.  In the special
            case where the `kdu_thread_queue::dependencies_can_propagate'
            function returns false, however, synchonized manipulation of
            the RUN bit can be avoided in the synchronous DWT case.
         -- LLA [1 bit] is the "last-line-accessed" flag that is used only
            when `num_stripes'=1.  This bit is set when the last available
            line of the stripe is accessed by the MCT machinery.  Specifically,
            during synthesis, the LLA bit is set when the last available line
            of the stripe is read for the first time (it may be read
            multiple times); during analysis, the LLA bit is set when the
            last available line of the stripe is made the current line,
            which actually happens after the previous line has been written.
            These definitions mean that in both cases, if the stripe only has
            one line the LLA bit remains permanently set.  In the case where
            the `kdu_thread_queue::dependencies_can_propagate' function
            returns false, manipulation of this bit is also skipped.
         -- T [1 bit] is set by the `request_termination' function to indicate
            that processing within this object should terminate as soon as
            possible.  The presence of the T bit prevents the scheduling of
            new jobs and causes `all_done' to be invoked when a currently
            running job completes.  The T bit is only of interest for the
            case in which the DWT runs in scheduled jobs (`num_stripes' > 1).
         [//]
         In the following, we discuss what happens when `num_stripes' is 1,
         meaning that the DWT runs synchronously in the same thread as
         multi-component transformation steps.  In this case there is no
         job scheduling here, but the function is responsible for passing
         dependency information along to a parent queue, if any.  The presence
         or absence of a parent queue is established during initialization,
         allowing the function to return immediately, without doing anything
         in the event that there is no parent.  When `num_stripes' is 1,
         the present function is only invoked by descendant queues (block
         encoding/decoding queues); however, the `dstate' member which it
         manipulates is also manipulated by calls to the auxiliary functions
         `lla_set', `dwt_start', `dwt_end' and `dwt_continue'.
         Specifically: `lla_set' is called when the last available line of
         the stripe is accessed by the MCT machinery; `dwt_start' is called
         when the synchronous DWT processing commences; `dwt_continue' is
         called after each line has been pushed/pulled to the DWT processing
         machinery, to determine whether or not the DWT processing should
         finish up due to the appearance of dependencies; and `dwt_end' is
         called once all DWT processing for the stripe buffer has been
         completed.  The `dstate.LLA' bit is reset, if appropriate, within
         the call to `dwt_end' or within a call to `dwt_continue' that
         returns false.  The most important feature of these auxiliary
         functions is that they manage the `dstate.RUN' flag and monitor
         changes in the `dstate' variable between the point at which the
         RUN bit was set by `dwt_start' and the point at which it is reset
         by `dwt_end' or `dwt_continue'.  While the RUN bit is set, no
         dependency information is propagated to a parent queue via calls
         to the present function.  When the RUN bit is reset within
         `dwt_end' or `dwt_continue', any dependency changes that have
         occurred are passed along via calls to `propagate_dependencies'.
         These steps ensure that dependency changes are only computed and
         propagated from points at which we can be sure that all dependency
         increments (positive changes in the number of dependencies) have
         been accounted for.  Otherwise, it can happen that the number of
         dependencies appears to go from, say 1 to 0, when in fact it has
         gone from 2 to 1 but the dependency increment that logically
         preceded the dependency decrements has not yet been processed due
         to delays experienced by its thread of execution.
            Subject to the above restrictions on the point at which
         dependencies can be propagated, the `propagate_dependencies' method
         is invoked with a `new_dependencies' value of 1, whenever the
         `dstate' variable transitions to a state in which the LLA bit is
         present and the NUM field identifies a positive number of
         dependencies upon descendant queues (`kdu_encoder' or `kdu_decoder'
         objects).  Similarly, `propagate_dependencies' is invoked with a
         `new_dependencies' value of -1 when the `dstate' variable transitions
         to a state in which these conditions do not both hold.
            In single-threaded DWT mode, a parent queue becomes free from
         the possibility of ever encountering blocking conditions in the
         future only once this is true for all descendant queues (`kdu_encoder'
         or `kdu_decoder' objects).  Accordingly, once the MAX field of
         the `dstate' variable transitions to 0, we invoke
         `propagate_dependencies' with a `delta_max_dependencies' argument of
         -1.  Again, though, the call to `propagate_dependencies' is delayed,
         if necessary, until the RUN bit is 0.  This ensures that a parent
         queue will never encounter the condition where there appear to be
         outstanding dependencies at the point when it is informed that there
         will not be any such dependencies in the future.
            Increments in the MAX field occur only during initialization of
         the descendant objects.  If the value becomes non-zero during
         this phase, the `propagate_dependencies' function is invoked with a
         `delta_max_dependencies' argument of 1.

  /* Notes:
        The members of this object are manipulated only by threads which
     actually perform DWT analysis/synthesis processing, although members of
     the base `kdu_thread_queue' object might be manipulated by other
     threads (especially block encoding/decoding threads that report
     dependency changes), which is why we separate the base from the
     extended object's variables via an L2 cache line of empty space.  Most
     of the members of this object are not used if `num_stripes' is 1,
     because their values would change synchronously with their namesakes
     within the `kd_multi_component' object.
        The `buffer' member points to an array with
     `num_stripes'*`max_stripe_rows' `kdu_line_buf' objects.  The array is
     actually embedded within a larger block of memory that is allocated
     from `kdu_sample_allocator' memory in a fancy way.  In practice, the
     value of `num_stripes' is set to 1 if and only if DWT processing is
     to be carried out synchronously, without scheduling jobs.  Values > 1
     (e.g., 2 in the simple case of double buffering) are used if DWT
     processing is to be carried out asynchronously via scheduled jobs.
        The `active_stripe' member points either to `buffer' or
     `buffer'+`max_stripe_rows', depending on which stripe is currently
     active for processing.
        The `rows_left_in_stripe' member indicates the number of rows that
     belong to the current `active_stripe', but have not yet been
     processed, while `next_stripe_row_idx' indicates the next row to be
     processed (synthesized or analyzed) within the active
     stripe.  The sum of these two quantities is always the total number
     of valid rows in the current `active_stripe'.
        The `comp_rows_left' member holds the number of image component rows
     that remain, starting from the first row of the `active_stripe'.  When
     the `active_stripe' has been fully processed, this value is decreased
     by `next_stripe_row_idx', which necessarily holds the total number of
     rows in the active stripe that was just processed.
        The `stripes_left_in_component' member holds the number of stripes
     that have yet to be fully processed, including the active stripe.  When
     the active stripe has been fully processed, this value is decreased
     by 1.
        The `dstate' member is a local replacement for the base
     object's `dependency_count' and `max_dependency_count' variables, but
     with extra fields to keep track of the state of running jobs and
     termination requests in a synchronous fashion.  The organization of
     the `dstate' variable into NUM, MAX, RUN, LLA and T fields is
     explained in the comments that follow the `update_dependencies' function,
     which also provide a thorough description of how it is used in the
     case where `num_stripes' = 1.  In what follows, we explain what happens
     for the case where `num_stripes' > 1, where DWT processing is performed
     by scheduled jobs.
        The `acc_new_dependencies' member accumulates all positive
     `new_dependencies' values passed to the `update_dependencies'
     function.  Negative values are accumulated immediately within
     the `dstate.NUM' field.  The positive values can arise only from within
     calls to `kdu_push_ifc::push' or `kdu_pull_ifc::pull'.  Each time such a
     push/pull call completes (i.e., after a new line of the image component
     has been synthesized or analyzed), the DWT processing job
     (`kd_multi_job::do_mt_analysis/synthesis') atomically adds the contents
     of `acc_new_dependencies' to the `dstate.NUM' bit field, resetting
     `acc_new_dependencies' to 0 as it does so.  In this way, it is able to
     determine whether or not potentially blocking conditions have arisen
     that might affect a subsequent push/pull call; if so, the
     job finishes and will be rescheduled automatically once the outstanding
     dependencies have been removed by subband encoding/decoding operations.
     Similar operations are performed for the case of `num_stripes'=1 where
     the DWT is done synchronously, rather than by multi-threaded processing
     jobs.
        The `have_all_scheduled' flag is set to true when a call to
     `schedule_job' passes true for the `all_scheduled' argument, or when
     a multi-threaded analysis or synthesis job function itself invokes
     the `all_scheduled' function.  The flag prevents multiple declarations
     of the all-scheduled condition and, more importantly, prevents the
     `do_mt_analysis' or `do_mt_synthesis' job functions from returning
     until all processing is complete -- if they return they will never be
     invoked again because no more jobs can be scheduled.
        The `sync_MDW' member points to a shared interlocked variable
     that actually resides within storage allocated by the
     `kdu_sample_allocator' within its own `KDU_L2_MAX_CACHE_LINE'-aligned
     block of memory.  By "shared" we mean that in multi-stripe
     applications, it is accessed both by DWT processing threads and by
     multi-component processing threads (of course, these might sometimes be
     the same thread); the pointer will be NULL if `num_stripes' < 2.
        This variable is best understood as a set of non-negative quantities
     (or bit-fields), denoted M, D and W.  M and D are guaranteed to lie in
     the range 0 to `num_stripes', while W is a 1-bit flag.  The bit-field
     locations and masks are defined by the macros `KD_MULTI_XFORM_SYNC_...'
     The semantic interpretation of the three bit-fields is as follows:
     -- M holds the number of stripes that are available to the MCT machinery
        and contain one or more individual lines which have not yet been read
        or written by the MCT machinery.
     -- D holds the number of stripes that are available to the DWT machinery
        and contain one or more individual lines which have not yet been read
        or written by the DWT machinery.
     -- W is a 1-bit flag that is set when the MCT machinery needs access to
        a stripe, but M=0 meaning none is available.  W should never be set
        unless M=0 -- changes are performed atomically using compare-and-set
        loops.
     The following is a brief synopsis of how M, D and W are updated.
     * During ANALYSIS:
        -- (M,D,W) is initialized to (`num_stripes',0,0).
        -- Whenever the MCT finishes generating a full stripe of image
           component rows, M is decremented and D is incremented.  If this
           leaves M=0, the `comp->line.line' member is reset (using
           `kdu_line_buf::destroy') so that the next time the MCT transform
           machinery requires access to a line from this image component,
           `comp->get_first_line_of_stripe' must be called.  That function
           deposits a reference to the relevant thread's current
           `kdu_thread_entity_condition' object in `comp->wakeup' and then
           enters a compare-and-set loop which sets the W flag to 1 if
           M is still 0, waiting if it does so, for the deposited condition
           object to be signalled -- `kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition'
           is used to realize the wait.
        -- Whenever the DWT analysis machinery finishes processing a stripe,
           D is decremented and M is incremented, simultaneously testing 
           and resetting W to 0.  If this causes M to transition from 0 to 1
           and W was 1, any `comp->wakeup' condition is signalled.
     * During SYNTHESIS:
        -- (M,D,W) is initialized to (0,`num_stripes',0).
        -- Whenever the MCT machinery causes `comp->rows_left_in_stripe' to
           become 0, M is decremented, without touching D.  This is done to
           reflect the fact that the next attempt to retrieve a line from
           this image component may potentially block the caller.
        -- When the MCT machinery finishes working with a stripe (this
           happens on the next line transition after the one that rendered
           `comp->rows_left_in_stripe' 0) the value of D is incremented
           without touching M.
        -- When the MCT machinery needs to access the first line of a stripe,
           if it encounters the M=0 condition, a compare-and-set loop is used
           to set W=1 (so long as M=0 persists) after first setting
           `comp->wakeup' to reference the thread's current
           `kdu_thread_entity_condition' object; the thread then waits inside
           `kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition' for the condition to be
           signalled.
        -- Whenever the DWT synthesis machinery finishes processing a stripe,
           D is decremented and M is incremented.  At the same time, the
           W bit is tested and reset.  If M transitions from 0 to 1 and
           the W flag was set, any `comp->wakeup' condition is signalled.
     * In BOTH CASES:
        -- Whenever D transitions to 0, the DWT processing job finishes, being
           careful to add 2^16 to `dependency_state' as it does so, which means
           that a new DWT job cannot be scheduled until the blocking
           dependency created by D=0 is cleared.
        -- Whenever D transitions from 0, `dependency_state' is decremented
           by (2^16) through a call to `update_dependencies'; this may result
           in the DWT job being rescheduled.
        -- Whenever M transitions to 0, any parent queue's
           `update_dependencies' function is invoked with a `new_dependencies'
           value of 1 to reflect the fact that M=0 presents a potentially
           blocking dependency for users of the `kdu_multi_analysis' or
           `kdu_multi_synthesis' object.
        -- Whenever M transitions from 0, any parent queue's
           `update_dependencies' function is invoked with a `new_dependencies'
           value of -1, meaning that the current image component no longer
           presents a potentially blocking dependency for users of the
           `kdu_multi_analysis' or `kdu_multi_synthesis' object.

  /* Notes:
        This object is used to form the `codestream_components' array
     in `kd_multi_transform'.  It manages all DWT analysis/synthesis
     operations, as required, together with intermediate buffering for
     image component lines prior to analysis or following synthesis.
     In multi-threaded application, DWT analysis/synthesis processing
     proceeds entirely within the space spanned by the `queue' member,
     while the multi-component processing machinery works with the
     remaining member variables, often in a different thread; for this
     reason, these two sets of working variables are separated sufficiently
     to ensure that the fall within different L2 cache lines to avoid
     false sharing bottlenecks on multi-processing platforms.
        Most of the member variables are identical to their namesakes within
     `kd_multi_queue' and this is deliberate.  The main difference is that
     the state variables that appear here refer to the state of the
     multi-component processing machinery while those that appear within
     `kd_multi_queue' refer to the state of the DWT processing machinery.
     During analysis, the `active_stripe' here advances ahead of that
     in `kdu_multi_queue', while the reverse is the case during synthesis.
        The `tmp_buffer', `buffer_base' and `sync_base' members deserve
     further explanation.  During the initialization phase, `tmp_buffer'
     is allocated from the heap to hold `num_stripes'*`max_stripe_rows'
     `kdu_stripe_buffer' objects.  The `kdu_sample_allocator' object
     is then used to pre-allocate all the necessary line buffers into this
     `tmp_buffer' array's members; it is also used to reserve an
     L2-aligned block of memory large enough to hold the final `buffers'
     array and another L2-aligned block of memory large enough to hold the
     interlocked variable that will eventually be referenced by
     `sync_MDW' (although this is not required if `num_stripes' is 1).
     Following pre-allocation, once the `kdu_sample_allocator' object is
     finalized, the `buffers' and `sync_MDW' pointers can be initialized
     to point into the reserved memory locations and the `tmp_buffers'
     contents are copied to the aligned block of memory associated with
     `buffers', whereupon the `tmp_buffers' array is deleted.
        `comp_idx' is the index of the corresponding codestream image
     component, as required by the `kdu_tile::access_component' function.
     This is not necessarily the ordinal position of the present structure
     within the `kd_multi_transform::codestream_components' array, since
     elements in the array follow the same order as the elements of the
     `kd_multi_collection::components' array in the object referenced by
     `kd_multi_transform::codestream_collection'.
        `line' is used to maintain the state of the current line being
     referenced from the `kd_multi_transform::codestream_collection' object.
     Its internal `line.line' member actually points to a line buffer
     within the `active_stripe' -- `next_stripe_row_idx' identifies the
     line that will next be used to initialize `line.line'.
        `rows_left_in_stripe' indicates the number of available rows within
     the current `active_stripe', not including the one referenced by
     `line.line'.  It follows, that if the stripe has only one row, this
     member will always be 0 in practice.
        `rows_left_in_component' is the total number of rows left in the
     current image component, not including the line referenced by `line.line'.
     This value is decremented each time `rows_left_in_stripe' decreases
     and `next_stripe_row_idx' advances.
        In the synchronous DWT mode (i.e., when `num_stripes'=1), the
     `next_stripe_row_idx' member is interpreted as a pointer into a circular
     buffer, so that the `rows_left_in_stripe' value need not be the difference
     between the stripe height and the value of `next_stripe_row_idx'.
