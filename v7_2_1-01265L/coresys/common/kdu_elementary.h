Description:
   Elementary data types and extensively used constants, plus important
elementary classes that have all-inline implementations.  It is possible that
the definitions here might need to be changed for some architectures.
   Note that from version 7.2.1, the most portable definitions have been
split off into the new "kdu_ubiquitous.h" header file, that is included
from here.  See that file's header for an explanation as to why this has
been done.

       The `kdu_thread' object provides you with a platform independent
       mechanism for creating, destroying and manipulating threads of
       execution on Windows, Unix/Linux and MAC operating systems at
       least -- basically, any operating system which supports
       the "pthreads" or Windows threads interfaces, assuming the necessary
       definitions are set up in "kdu_elementary.h".

       The `kdu_thread' object can also be initialized with the `set_to_self'
       function to refer to the calling thread, but in this case the
       `destroy' function does nothing and the `add_thread_object' function
       will not save thread objects for deletion when the thread is
       destroyed.
       [//]
       If a new thread is created by calling `kdu_thread::create', the
       executing thread can recover a reference to its `kdu_thread' object
       by invoking the static `get_thread_ref' member function.  One reason
       you might be interested in this is that it allows custom objects
       to be registered with the thread via `kdu_thread::add_thread_object',

    KDU_EXPORT bool set_cpu_affinity(kdu_long affinity_mask);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The purpose of this function is to indicate preferences for
           the logical CPU's the thread should run on.  This function
           might not be implemented on all operating systems and the
           `affinity_mask' might be interpreted differently on different
           operating systems.
           [//]
           The principle interpretation of `affinity_mask' is that
           it holds a set of flag bits, with one flag for each logical
           CPU on which the thread would like to be able to run.  The
           LSB corresponds to the first logical CPU in the system.
           No more than 64 logical CPU's can be identified using
           this mechanism.  Currently, this interpretation holds under
           Windows and Linux.
           [//]
           Under OSX, the `affinity_mask' must be converted to a 32-bit
           integer that identifies groups of threads that wish to be
           scheduled on logical CPU's that have some shared physical
           resource (shared L2 cache, shared L3 cache, same die, etc.).
           To do this, the implementation currently forms this 32-bit
           identifier from the index of the least significant non-zero bit
           in the `affinity_mask' and the index of the most significant
           non-zero bit in the `affinity_mask'.  In most practical
           applications, this is likely to produce the desired outcome,
           unless you assign affinity masks to different threads whose
           set bits partially overlap with one another.
           [//]
           Although this function should be executable from any thread
           in the system, experience shows that some platforms do not behave
           correctly unless the function is invoked from within the thread
           whose processor affinity is being modified.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the thread has not been successfully created, or the
           `affinity_mask' is invalid, or the calling thread does not
           have permission to set the CPU affinity of another thread, or
           operating support has not yet been extended to offer this
           specific feature.

             constructs built from atomic interlocked operations, in which
             a short wait turns out to be unexpectedly long -- probably
             because the operation that another thread is expected to
             perform within a few clock cycles is interrupted by that
             thread being rescheduled.  Yielding our own thread's execution
             slice increases the likelihood that the other thread will be
             brought back to life, especially important if there is only
             one physical processor.

             not use this function except within a "spin-loop" which
             expects the condition it is waiting for to become available
             imminently, but finds that it has taken longer than expected
             (typically based on a spin count), which may mean that the
             CPU needs to be yielded back to the scheduler so that it
             can satisfy the condition.

             do not create or destroy the underlying synchronization
             primitive itself.
             [//]
             If `manual_reset' is true, the event object remains set from the
             point at which `set' is called, until `reset' is called.  During
             this interval, multiple waiting threads may be woken up --
             depending on whether a waiting thread invokes `reset' before
             another waiting thread is woken.
             [//]
             If `manual_reset' is false, the event is automatically reset once
             any thread's call to `wait' succeeds.  If there are other
             threads which are also waiting for the event, they will not
             be woken up until the `set' function is called again.
             [//]
             As a general rule, the automatic reset approach should be
             preferred over manual reset for efficiency reasons and it is
             best to minimize the number of threads which might wait on the
             event.
