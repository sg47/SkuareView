Description:
   Simple example using the Kakadu Java native interfaces.  Similar to the
native C++ application, "kdu_render", except that the rendered image is
painted on the screen.  If the image is too large to fit on the screen only
its upper left hand corner will actually be displayed.  The intent here is
not to replicate the full functionality of a viewer such as "kdu_show"
in Java, although this could certainly be done.

/* END NOTE 1:
      Enclosing code in a try/catch clause allows you to catch any errors
      which may be generated by the Kakadu core system (or from elements
      of the Java implementation).  The way this works is worth explaining
      briefly in the sequel.
      
      If internal errors are generated through the core error
      service `kdu_error', they will be routed to the `pretty_syserr'
      object we installed using `kdu_global.kdu_customize_errors' above.
          Note: The simplest way to generate your own `kdu_error' errors
          from Java is to use the `Kdu_global.Kdu_print_error' function.
      When the `kdu_error' object is destroyed at the end of the
      internal error clause, it issues a call to our `pretty_syserr'
      object's `Flush' function, with the `end_of_message' argument
      set to true.  The `pretty_syserr' object issues calls to
      `syserr.Put_text' (for printing the message) and `sysout.Flush'
      (when `pretty_syserr.Flush' is called).  Our `syserr' object
      has been derived from `Kdu_message' in such a way as to override
      the `Kdu_message.Put_text' and `Kdu_message.Flush' functions.
      The latter throws an exception when it receives the end of message
      flush call.  The exception unwinds the execution stack all the
      way back to the catch clause appearing below.  This is designed
      to be robust from the inside to the outside.
      
      When an exception is thrown, the Kakadu Java bindings
      (implemented in "kdu_jni.dll") automatically cleanup any
      temporary resources they have allocated for inter-operability.
      Also, the Kakadu native implementation's exception handling
      should destroy any resources which would otherwise be lost.
      From the catch clause, you should find yourself in a safe
      position to continue interacting with any Kakadu objects you
      have created (e.g., a `Kdu_codestream' interface), but the
      normal response will be to destroy such objects (see END NOTE 3).
*/

/* END NOTE 2:
      Seeming as our implementation of the `Kdu_sysout_message.Flush'
      function throws exceptions, if the Kakadu native code generates
      an error through `kdu_error', we expect that exception to be caught
      by "catch (KduException)".
          Actually, all `KduException' exceptions thrown from Kakadu
      callback functions (functions marked with the [BIND: callback] option
      -- designed to be implemented in a derived object) are automatically
      converted to C++ exceptions of type `kdu_exception' (actually an integer)
      with the value derived from `KduException.Get_kdu_exception_code()'.
      C++ exceptions may also be thrown directly from inside
      Kakadu native objects.
          On the way back out, all C++ exceptions (including those
      which were converted from Java `KduException' exceptions) are
      automatically wrapped by the Java bindings as Java exceptions of type
      `KduException', with the relevant exception code inside.  If a
      `kdu_exception' was caught, that is the code wrapped in the
      Java `KduException'.  Otherwise, the code is 0.
          The one caveat worth mentioning to the above cases is memory
      allocation exceptions.  If these occur within a callback function, they
      are rethrown as a C++ `std::bad_alloc' exception.  Conversely, if a
      `std::bad_alloc' exception is thrown inside the native implementation
      of a Java interface to Kakadu, the exception is thrown as
      `java/lang/OutOfMemoryError'.
*/

/* END NOTE 3:
      By and large, the Java environment automatically garbage
      collects objects you have allocated, including those associated
      with the internal Kakadu system -- this causes the internal
      objects to be destroyed.  However, the garbage collector has
      two important weaknesses: 1) it gives you no control over the
      order of destruction (which is sometimes important for the
      native code); and 2) it will not destroy internal objects
      which are not owned by Java objects.

      To clarify this second point, Kakadu defines a special type of
      class known as an INTERFACE class, whose content is actually a
      reference to an opaque internal entity.  Kakadu allows any
      number of copies of INTERFACE objects to be made, since they
      are all references to the same internal object.  INTERFACE classes
      have no C++ destructor, because the internal object is not intended
      to be destroyed when the INTERFACE object goes out of scope.  For
      this reason, when a Java instance of an INTERFACE class is garbage
      collected, the internal object will also remain untouched (it must,
      for safety).  Although INTERFACE objects have no destructor,
      any INTERFACE object, whose internal representation can be
      explicitly destroyed, also provides an explicit `Destroy'
      member function.  You must call the `Destroy' function
      yourself, to destroy interfaces that you have explicitly
      created, exactly as you would from C++.  An example of this is the
      call to `Kdu_codestream.Destroy' above.
      
      Whether or not an object belongs to a Kakadu INTERFACE class
      should be very clear from the documentation generated by
      "kdu_hyperdoc", which also created the Java bindings for you.
      If in any doubt at all, look for the presence of a `Destroy'
      member function.

      To address the need to control the order of destruction
      of native Kakadu objects (as opposed to just relying on Java
      garbage collection), you will find that the language
      bindings generated by "kdu_hyperdoc" provide a `Native_destroy'
      member function for you.  This destroys the native Kakadu
      object, leaving the garbage collector to cleanup the outer
      shell of the object which you see from Java.  Do not attempt to
      use the object after its `Native_destroy' function has been called.
      Of course, Kakadu INTERFACE classes do not provide `Native_destroy'.
      If the internal resource can be explicitly destroyed, you will find
      a `Destroy' member function, as explained above.
      
      For Kakadu objects which provide a visible public destructor, the
      `Native_destroy' function will be public and may be overridden.  You
      may need to override this function in a Java derived class to make
      sure you clean up its resources as well, or to invoke the
      `Native_destroy' function of other Kakadu-derived objects.
