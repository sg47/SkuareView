Description:
   Defines the main image management and rendering object associated with
any given window's view.  The `kdms_renderer' object works hand in hand
with `kdms_window' and its document view, `kdms_document_view'.  In fact,
menu commands and other user events received by those objects are mostly
forwarded directly to the `kdms_renderer' object.

        This structure is used to store key geometric parameters associated
     with the imagery that is supposed to be presented to the display.  The
     main purpose is to allow atomic exchange of this information between the
     main window management thread and the `kdms_renderer::paint_region'
     function, that may be invoked from a separate display thread during
     animation.  The information is recorded within the
     `kdms_region_compositor' object.
        The `image_dims' member holds the same information returned by
     `kdu_region_compositor::get_total_image_dims'.  The `viewport_dims'
     member holds the dimensions and location of a region, contained within
     `image_dims' that is supposed to be displayed within an image view
     window.
        The `orientation' member records the geometric orientation
     parameters (passed to `kdu_region_compositor::set_scale') that affect
     the interpretation of the `image_dims' and `viewport_dims' members.
     For example, if transposition is used, this is recorded in the
     `orientation.trans' member, but `image_dims' and `viewport_dims'
     also reflect the prevailing transposition.
        The `pixel_scale' member holds the scaling factor that is supposed
     to be applied during the rendering of the `viewport_dims' region to
     the display.
        The `focus_box' and `focus_state' parameters record any user-defined
     focus box that may need to be drawn over the image itself.  If
     `focus_state' is 0, there is no focus box.  Other values of `focus_state'
     might affect the way a focus box is rendered. */

  /* This class augments the `kdu_region_compositor' class with display
   buffer management logic which allocates image buffers whose lines are
   all aligned on 16-byte boundaries.  It also recycles buffers, to
   minimize excessive allocation and reallocation of large blocks of
   memory.  This can potentially improve cache utilization in video
   applications.
      This class also provides synchronized functions to manage interaction
   with the composition buffer queue.  These functions both protect access
   to the composition queue with an appropriate mutex lock and provide added
   functionality to the primitive queue management functions.  In particular,
   they allow the application to manage jitter absorbtion buffers with
   as few as 2 buffers in total (one queued buffer and one working buffer)
   with minimal blocking between the presentation and main working
   threads.  You should only use the protected functions provided here,
   rather than directly invoking `push_composition_buffer',
   `pop_composition_buffer' or `inspect_composition_queue'.
      Finally, the class provides methods for managing the current display
   geometry, which simplifies the buffer painting workflow.  Not only is
   the display geometry (including focus box information) protected by a mutex
   so that it can be robustly accessed by a separate drawing thread, but the
   object also ensures that the head of the composition buffer queue (if any)
   is treated as "dirty" if any of this information changes, so that calls to
   `lock_new_composition_queue_head' will see a need to present the
   most relevant queued composition buffer, even if it is already marked
   as having been presented.
      You can take this class as a template for designing richer
   buffer management systems -- e.g. ones which might utilize display
   hardware explicitly. */

         0.1*(`next_display_event_time'-`display_event_time'), so as to
         avoid any jitter due to numerical round-off errors in the event
         that the display events are separated by exactly the same amount
         as the underlying source frame display times.
            The function does not assume that display times are monotonic
         within the queue, so it is possible for the processing thread to
         push older frames onto the queue to override existing ones.  In
         this case, the policy mentioned above, will skip through the
         initial frames and settle on the most recently pushed frame if
         it has a display time that is within the threshold.
            If no appropriate buffer is found, or the most appropriate
         buffer has already been marked as presented (see

         to redraw (see `set_display_geometry'), the function returns false.

         be popped by `conditionally_push_composition_buffer'.

         present it to the screen.  `unlock_and_mark_composition_queue_head'
         should then be called to mark the queue head as having been
         presented and also unlock it so that calls to
         `conditionally_push_composition_buffer' can reuse its storage, if
         required.
            The `display_event_time' and `next_display_event_time' values
         are recorded internally and may later be recovered from any thread
         via the `get_display_event_times' function.

         The function also searches later elements in the composition queue
         for the first one in which the frame index, animation metanode
         or JPIP progress differ from the values returned here.  This
         last functionality deserves more explanation.  On entry,
         `next_frame_change_time', `next_metanode_change_time' and
         `next_progress_change_time' hold thresholds on the display times for
         future animation frames in which the frame index, metanode or
         JPIP progress value might differ from those returned here.  On exit,
         the relevant threshold is replaced by -1 if the function was unable
         to find any future animation frames whose display time is <= the
         threshold and for which the relevant quantity differs.  Otherwise, the
         relevant threshold is replaced by the actual display time of the
         future animation frame in which the change occurs.  The principle
         reason for recovering this information is to allow the caller to
         implement a mechanism for determining the best times to
         periodically update status or metadata display status.  If a threshold
         is -ve on entry, it remains -ve on exit.

         The `display_time' should be identical to the value already recorded
         via `kdms_compositor_buf::set_display_time' in the current working
         buffer, but we don't explicitly check this here. The function
         provides three extra features, in addition to serializing access to
         the composition buffer queue via an internal mutex.
            The first extra feature is that the function automatically pops
         buffers from the head of the composition queue (assuming it is not
         locked), if either the buffer is marked as having been presented (see
         `unlock_and_mark_composition_queue_head') or the buffer has a later
         display time (see `kdms_compositor_buf::get_display_time') than the
         one provided here; the idea is that the processing thread may have
         been asked to regenerate frames that were previously pushed to the
         queue because conditions have changed (e.g., zoom factor, orientation,
         buffer size, etc.).
            The second extra feature is that the function automatically
         replaces the tail of the composition queue if that buffer's
         display time as well as the `display_time' argument supplied
         here both fall within the threshold T that we expect to be
         used in the next call to `lock_new_composition_queue_head' -- this
         value was estimatedby the last call to that function.
            The third extra feature is that the function will not allow the
         composition buffer queue to grow beyond `max_queued_buffers' in
         length; it returns false if this restriction prevents the working
         buffer from being pushed onto the queue.  It also returns false if
         the underlying call to `push_composition_buffer' fails -- typically
         because the working buffer has not yet been fully processed. */

       strategies, depending on the machine architecture, word alignment
       and whether or not a focus box is required.

       main application/processing thread.  It is also complicated by the
       fact that the composition buffer that we use for drawing may either
       be the current working buffer or one which was pushed onto the
       `compositor's composition queue, possibly under different viewing
       conditions.  Finally, it is important to recognize that for buffers
       which are obtained from the composition queue, there are two modes
       of operation, depending on whether the animation process is
       deliberately moving the view around or the viewport is under user
       control.  The former case may hold if there is a non-empty animation
       region of interest (second extra region stored with
       `kdms_compositor_buf').  We describe the approach firstly for the case
       in which there is no animation region of interest.
       ----------------------------------------
       Without any animation region of interest
       ----------------------------------------
          Firstly, we use `kdms_region_compositor::get_display_geometry' to
       recover the image and viewport dimensions and locations, as understood
       at the current point of time, which may differ from their values at the
       time when the composition buffer was generated.  Write
       `display_image_dims' and `display_viewport' for these quantities.
       At the same time, we also get the current orientation information for
       the display, which we write as `display_orientation'.
          Next, we use the `kdms_compositor::get_composition_buffer_ex'
       function to recover the image dimensions, buffer dimensions/location
       and prevailing orientation that were current at the time the relevant
       composition buffer was created/queued.  Call these `buf_image_dims',
       `buf_viewport' and `buf_orientation', respectively.
          By comparing `buf_image_dims.size' with `display_image_dims.size'
       and combining this information with the prevailing `pixel_scale',
       we recover the appropriate scaling factor for presenting the buffered
       data.    If `buf_orientation' and `display_orientation' disagree, the
       function draws nothing, since we can expect a new frame buffer to be
       pushed to the composition queue shortly; otherwise, we can expect
       the horizontal and vertical scaling factors to agree (at least very
       closely).
          If `region_ref' is NULL, the function is being invoked directly from
       the presentation thread and the intention is to repaint the entire
       viewport from the available buffer data, if possible.  In this case, the
       function also modifies its behaviour to account for the fact that the
       graphics context is configured for painting relative to the window
       frame, as opposed to the document view (the window frame includes a
       scrollbar, status, etc., so that it is not appropriate to paint at the
       very bottom of the window).  Otherwise, *`region_ref' represents the
       portion of the viewport that we are being asked to paint, expressed
       relative to the document view coordinate system.
          Using the scaling factor derived above, the region identified by
       a non-NULL `region_ref' argument is mapped to the coordinate system
       of `buf_image_dims' and `buf_dims' and used to extract the relevant
       buffer data to paint to the graphics context.  It is possible that the
       buffer will be too small to paint the entire region identified by
       `region_ref' or the entire viewport.  In this case, if `region_ref' is
       non-NULL, the function fills in unpainted content with a white
       background.
       ------------------------------------
       With an animation region of interest
       ------------------------------------
          In this case, we need to consider that the `buf_dims' region has
       been determined by the animator in an attempt to centre it over the
       animation ROI, to the extent that this is possible or useful.
       We take care of this by finding a "viewport-shift" value to apply to
       the current viewport and continuing as if we were rendering the
       shifted viewport.

       node, the ROI is associated with the first codestream.  If the numlist
       node's image entities do no intersect with what is being displayed
       or none of an ROI node's associated codestreams are being displayed, the
       display is changed to include at least one of the relevant image
       entities.  If there is an ROI node, the imagery is panned and zoomed
       in order to make the region clearly visible and the focus box is
       adjusted to fit around the ROI node's bounding box.
          During interactive JPIP browsing, it can happen that the image
       information required to complete a call to this function are not yet
       available in the cache.  When this happens, the function does as much
       as it can but leaves behind a record of the `node' argument in the
       `pending_show_metanode' member variable, so that the function can be
       automatically called again when new data arrives in the cache.  Such
       pending show events can potentially disrupt future user navigation, so
       the `cancel_pending_show' function is provided, to be called in the
       event of user interaction which might invalidate a pending attempt to
       change the display.  That function is invoked under just about any
       user interaction events which could affect the main image view.
          If `node' happens to be an empty interface, the function does
       nothing.  On the other hand, if the most recent call to this function
       supplied exactly the same `node' and if multiple frames (in frame
       composition mode) or multiple compositing layers (in single compositing
       layer rendering mode) or multiple codestreams (in single codestream
       rendering mode) can be considered to be associated with the `node',
       this function advances the view to the next associated one.  To enable
       this behaviour, the function saves the identity of the `node' supplied
       most recently to this funcion in the `last_show_metanode' variable.
          The function returns false if it was unable to find compatible
       imagery, perhaps because the relevant imagery has not yet become
       available in a dynamic cache, as explained above.  Otherwise, the
       function returns true, even if no change was made in the image
       being viewed -- so long as it is compatible.
          The `istream_ref' argument can be used to obtain the identity of
       the imagery stream (istream) associated with a successful outcome of
       the function -- the value at `istream_ref' may actually be modified
       even if the function returns false, but in that case the value
       should be ignored.  If `node' identified a compositing layer,
       the corresponding ilayer's primary istream is returned.  If `node'
       identified a specific codestream, the corresponding istream is
       returned.  If `node' identified a specific region of interest, the
       istream against which the region is registered is returned here.
       If none of the above cases hold, `istream_ref' is set to a null
       reference.  The `istream_ref' argument is particularly useful in
       view of the fact that the `node' may be associated with many
       codestreams or compositing layers and that each individual
       codestream or compositing layer may be associated with multiple
       imagery layers in the current composition, so it can be difficult
       or even impossible otherwise for the caller to figure out which
       imagery layer was the one used by a successful call to this
       function to base the displayed content. */

  bool render_refresh(bool new_imagery_only=false);
    /* The purpose of this function is to call `compositor->refresh' and
       then deal with the possibility that upon refreshing its understanding
       of what is being rendered, the compositor may discover that the
       current viewing conditions are not supported by the source (unlikely
       but possible if, for example, a required codestream becomes available
       for the first time from a dynamic cache and it turns out that this
       codestream does not have sufficient DWT levels to support the
       current viewing scale).
          This function is invoked from `refresh_display', but also from
       other places.  The reason for separating `refresh_display' and
       the lower level `refresh_compositor' functions is animation.  If
       there is an animation in progress, refreshing the display generally
       means that `advance_animation' needs to be called with the special
       value of -1.0 to force the animation frame generation process to go
       back and regenerate the one that is most relevant for display at
       the current time, effectively obliterating any later frames that may
       be sitting in the display queue.
          If `new_imagery_only', the function does nothing unless a compositing
       layer or pending MJ2 frame change becomes available for the first time
       as a result of newly available codestream content.  The function can
       be called immediately with this option if any new data arrives in the
       cache from a JPIP server -- without the `new_imagery_only' argument
       being true, the function should be called at most episodically, to
       avoid wasting too much processing time.  The function returns true
       only if something was actually refreshed by `compositor->refresh'.
       The return value is of interest only to the `client_notification'
       function which calls the function with `new_imagery_only' equal to
       true if the compositor is still waiting for some codestreams and
       takes steps to ensure that JPIP requests are regenerated if something
       was refreshed.
          The `render_refresh' function plays a very important role in
       remote image and video browsing via JPIP.  In this context, the
       function interacts with state variables `jpip_wants_render_refresh'
       and `earliest_render_refresh_time'.  These deserve some explanation
       here.  Whenever new data arrives in the JPIP client's
       cache, the `jpip_wants_render_refresh' variable is set, indicating
       that whatever rendering processes are being performed or have been
       performed may need to be redone in order to fully utilize all data
       that is available.
          The `jpip_wants_render_refresh' variable is reset only in this
       function -- not in any other place, except for object construction
       and file close operations.  This is because, we cannot rely upon any
       compositor outputs being completely up to date unless
       `compositor->refresh' has been called -- even if
       the codestream, compositing layer or frame being generated by the
       compositor is changed by `initialize_regions' or `set_frame', there
       is always the possibility that previously generated surfaces are
       re-used without being fully regenerated.
          If `jpip_wants_render_refresh' is true we will eventually have to
       call the present function again some time, but when we do this is
       important.  We would at least like to wait until all rendering
       associated the the last refresh has finished before we start rendering
       again -- actually we want to wait at least `jpip_refresh_interval'
       seconds beyond that point.  The `earliest_render_refresh_time' state
       variable keeps track of the earliest time at which the present function
       should be called again; it is set to -1.0 inside this function (and
       only here) and this condition is detected within `on_idle' once the
       compositor's rendering operations are found to be complete.  At that
       point, the `on_idle' function sets the earliest time at which the
       next call to `render_refresh' should occur in response to
       `jpip_wants_render_refresh'.

       clear outstanding render refresh calls immediately after we configure
       the compositor to do some other task, if possible -- this minimizes
       needless processing.  Thus, if `configure_overlays' reconfigures the
       compositor's overlay painting machinery, this is a good time to try
       to clear any oustanding `render_refresh'.  Similarly, the function is
       called at the end of a successful call to `initialize_regions',
       after changing frames within `set_frame' and, if `set_frame' was not
       called, after advancing the animation within `advance_animation'.

       `get_current_time' need not be called again.  However, there is
       no point in evaluating the time if you do not already know it when

       else schedules a wakeup call for the earliest point at which a render
       refresh can be issued.
          As with `perform_any_outstanding_render_refresh', the `cur_time'
       argument is provided as a convenience from contexts where the current
       time has recently been evaluated.  If -ve, the function invokes
       `get_current_time' itself if the time needs to be known. */
  void configure_overlays(double cur_time, bool in_wakeup);
    /* This function handles all aspects of the metadata overlay drawing and
       highlighting state machinery.  One role for the function is to invoke
       `compositor->configure_overlays' with the appropriate parameters for
       the current state, which may cause overlays to be turned off, or
       modulated in intensity.  The other role for the function is to advance
       the state machines associated with any non-zero values of
       `overlay_highlight_state' or `overlay_flashing_state', based on the
       `cur_time' argument and the `next_overlay_change_time' member.
          If `cur_time' is -ve on entry, the function resets the overlay
       modulation scheduler, so that `next_overlay_change_time' is obtained by
       adding the relevant dwell time to the current system time.  Otherwise,
       dwell times are added to the current value of `next_overlay_change_time'
       and the function checks to see if multiple state changes are required
       to catch up with the current time -- this is because heavy processing
       load may have caused some state changes to be missed.  
          The function may be called from anywhere, but when called from
       within the `wakeup' function, the `in_wakeup' argument will be true.
       In this case, the function does not invoke
       `install_next_scheduled_wakeup', even if the next wakeup time is
       changed, because that function is going to be called once `wakeup'
       finishes making all required adjustments.  Also, when `in_wakeup' is
       true, the function does not invoke `compositor->configure_overlays'
       unless all processing is complete -- the function will be called again
       from within `on_idle' once processing actually does complete.
          This function is also used during animation, in which case the
       `animator' member will be non-NULL.  In this case, the function ignores
       both the arguments, advancing the overlay state machinery based upon
       the values of `next_overlay_change_time' and the current animation
       frame's display time, as returned by `animator->get_display_time'.

       Starting from the current frame and track (if any), it scans through
       the frames in the JPX source, looking for one which matches at least
       one of the compositing layers in the `numlist'.  If the number list
       identifies one or more codestreams, at least one of these must be
       used (or potentially used) by the matching frame.  Moreover, if the
       `regions' array is non-empty, at least one of the regions must be
       visible, with respect to at least one of the codestreams in the
       number list node.  In any case, if a match is found and the number
       list identifies one or more codestreams, the matching codestream is
       written to the `compatible_codestream_idx' argument; otherwise, this
       argument is left untouched.  Similarly, if a match is found, the
       index of the matching compositing layer (the layer in the frame within
       which the match is found) is written to `compatible_layer_idx'.
       [//]
       If the function fails to find a match in the current track (defaults to
       0 or 1 if there is no current track), the function considers later
       tracks, eventually looping back to the first frame of the first track
       until all frames of all tracks have been considered.  Rather than
       explicitly visiting all these frames, the function takes advantage
       of the powerful `jpx_composition::find_numlist_match' API.
       [//]
       If a match is found, a non-empty `jpx_frame' interface is returned

       time with `match_all_layers' false.  This option is ignored if
       the number list defines any codestreams or is embedded in a JPX
       container and references base compositing layer indices for that

       explanation of this.

       The `install_next_schedule_wakeup' function is invoked to actually

       times do not need to be very precise.  The relevant functions adjust
       these wakeup times if possible so as to minimize unnecessary wakeup
       calls.  Note that there is no function to schedule overlay change
       wakeups here, because that is always done directly from within the

       a) `on_idle' when processing of an animation frame has just completed;

       c) `wakeup' when a scheduled animation frame advance event occurs; and
       d) `kdms_window:display_notification' when the run-loop passes along
          notification of the display of one or more frames by the
          presentation thread.
       The above cover all conditions under which a new animation frame
       might be ready to push onto the composition buffer queue, or a new
       call to 'advance_animation' might be appropriate.
          The function relies upon the frame presentation thread
       asynchronously using frames that are on the queue; it pops the head
       of the queue only if it has already been used.
          The function implements a policy in which the composition buffer
       queue never contains more than `animation_max_queued_frames' frames
       and the value returned by `animator->get_suggested_advance_delay'
       is <= 0.
          If `cur_system_time' is -ve, it must be evaluated (as required) by
       calling `get_current_time' from within the function.
