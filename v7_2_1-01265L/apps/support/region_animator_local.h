         object used to implement `kdu_region_compositor'.  Each of the two

         "fsiz" request which specifies "round-to-nearest" (first entry) and
         "round-up" (second entry), respectively.  Values are based upon the
         primary codestream used by the compositing layer and, in particular,
         its "reference image component" -- these properties have already
         been determined when this object was created.  The key features of
         interest to this function are the reference component's sub-sampling
         factors (relative to the high resolution codestream grid) and the
         effective sub-sampling factors for the reference component that
         arise at `active_discard_levels' (`active_subs'), with one more
         discarded resolution level (`low_subs') and with one less discarded
         resolution level (`high_subs').  The function tries to find
         lower and upper bounds for the amount of extra scaling (beyond
         the global scaling factor that was used to arrive at the value of
         `active_subs') that should be applied to the full composited image
         size and any region of interest, such that a JPIP server will
         arrive at the decision that the number of discarded resolution
         levels for this codestream should be equal to `active_discard_levels'.
         The main reason we need to hunt for these values is that the
         JPIP request syntax is based on the assumption that the full set
         of resolution levels for a codestream produces imagery with a
         natural resolution equal to that of the high resolution grid,
         whereas from a signal processing point of view, the full resolution
         imagery has a natural resolution which is smaller by a factor
         that is given by `ref_subs'.  Accordingly, if `ref_subs' is not
         equal to (1,1), the best rendering of the composited surface at
         some scale requires the JPIP server to be coerced into believing
         that the scale is larger by the factor `ref_subs'.  Additional
         complexities are introduced when Part-2 non-Mallat Wavelet
         transform styles are used. */

     `active_discard_levels' into account, in order to achieve the `scale'
     value passed to `configure', multiplied by the reference image
     component's sub-sampling factors.  These factors need to be taken
     into account because the JPIP-defined procedure for determining
     the number of resolution levels to discard from a codestream is
     based on the assumption that full scale rendering (without any
     discarding of resolution levels) produces an image whose dimensions
     are those of the high resolution reference grid (i.e., the codestream

         new matching animation frame between the current one and the next --
         this might fail, meaning only that the next animation frame is
         already holding the next match within the span.  In reverse play
         mode, the function does the same thing, except that it does nothing

         (self-efacing), so you must not access it after a -ve return.
            In addition to `frame_idx', the function fills out
         `source_duration' (if it is -ve, meaning not already known),
         `frame_size' and `frame_roi'.  It can happen that some
         of this information cannot yet be determined, due to insufficient
         information in a dynamic cache.  If this happens, the function

         be that even the metadata required to instantiate the frame in the
         first place is not yet available  (i.e., `is_metadata_incomplete'
         returns true), in which case the function also returns with

            Finally, it may be that all required metadata is available but
         some of the main codestream headers are missing, in which case the

         the caller that the current object has not been removed, but some
         source frame information is still missing.

  /* Notes:
        The `incomplete_xxx' members are used only if this object is being
     used to keep track of a metanode for which insufficient information
     was available to recover actual animation frames during the relevant
     call to `kdu_region_animator::add_metanode'.  If `metanode' was a link
     node, but the target of the link could not be resolved yet, the
     `incomplete_link_target' flag is set.  Otherwise, if `metanode's
     may potentially yield animation frames but could not all be recovered
     yet, the `incomplete_descendant' flag is set.  In this second case,
     `incomplete_prev' identifies the last descendant of `metanode' that
     has actually been resolved -- may be empty if none have yet been
     resolved; this is passed as the `ref' argument to
     `metanode.get_next_descendant'.  The `incomplete_top_level' flag is
     set if this frame was added directly by
     `kdu_region_animator::add_metanode'.  The `incomplete_numlist_above'
     flag indicates whether a number list node has already been encountered
     during the recursive search for metadata with which to create frames --
     this recursive search is implemented by the
     `expand_incomplete_frame_metadata' function.
        Once a metadata node has been resolved, so that a metadata-driven
     animation frame is available, the possibility may exist for the metadata
     node to be expanded into multiple animation frames, each revealing the
     metadata's compositing layers or a region of interest in a different way.
     We refer to the complete collection of metadata-driven animation frames
     that are derived from a single `metanode' as the node's "span".  The
     first and last members of the span are tagged with the `first_match' and
     `last_match' flags.  In many (perhaps most) cases, a single frame
     represents the entire span, so `first_match' and `last_match' are both
     true.  However, if the span can be split, this is done by the
     `extend_numlist_match_span'.  Once the span has been split into separate
     first and last frames, intermediate frames may be created, but those are
     temporary -- they will be removed once the animation runs sufficiently
     past them.  The first and last frames in a span, however, are not
     removed, except that in some cases the discovery of new content in a
     dynamic cache may allow the `extend_numlist_match_span' to advance the
     last frame in the span, rendering the previous last frame an intermediate
     temporary frame.
        In frame composition mode, metadata-driven animation frames are
     discovered using the powerful `jpx_composition::find_numlist_match'
     function.  The `match_track_idx' and `match_track_or_above' members are
     used to implement the consistent frame discovery algorithm described
     in connection with that function.  In particular, at each point in the
     search for new matching frames, `match_track_idx' holds the minimum
     JPX presentation track index that is consistent with the frames
     that have been discovered so far to match the `numlist' specifications,
     while `match_track_or_above' is true if all of these frames are
     compatible with higher presentation track indices; otherwise, only
     those frames that have `match_track_idx' as their presentation track
     index, or that belong to the last presentation track in their context
     (top-level or JPX container) can be considered compatible.  These
     constraints are supplied to `jpx_composition::find_numlist_match'.
     It is worth noting that not all matched frames necessarily become
     `kdra_frame' animation frames.  In particular, we do not allow two
     consecutive `kdra_frame's to match exactly the same compositing layers
     from the `numlist' specification.
        In single layer mode, the number of metadata-driven frames that belong
     to a span is discovered using the `jpx_metanode::count_numlist_layers'
     function and each specific metadata-driven frame is characterised by its
     `single_numlist_layer' member.  That member is not a compositing layer
     index, but rather an enumerator that lies in the range 0 through C-1
     where C is the count returned by `numlist.count_numlist_layers'.  This
     enumerator is passed to `jpx_metanode::get_numlist_layer' with a
     `rep_idx' of -1.
        If `conditional_step_display_time' has a positive value, an extra
     "frame-step" has been inserted within the nominal span of the frame.
     This may be done by `insert_conditional_frame_step' or by
     `notify_client_progress' and then only to the animation's current
     presentation frame.  At the same time, each of these functions sets the
     `min_conditional_step_gap' member to reflect the condition under which
     the frame step will be introduced when `advance_animation' is next
     called -- a frame step is introduced only if its display time is
     strictly less than `min_conditional_step_gap' seconds less than the
     start of the next animation frame, unless of course there is no next
     animation frame that is available.  If and when `advance_animation'
     advances to a conditional frame step, the `cur_display_time' member is
     set equal to the `conditional_step_display_time' and the conditional
     frame step is cancelled -- see `remove_conditional_frame_step'.
     Conditional frame steps are also removed if the animation playback
     direction is reversed.
        The `conditional_step_is_auto_refresh' member identifies whether an
     existent conditional frame step has been inserted by
     `notify_client_progress', as an auto-refresh step, or by
     `insert_conditional_frame_step', as an application-defined frame step.
     It is important to distinguish between these two cases, because
     application-defined frame steps always override auto-refresh frame
     steps.
        `cur_roi_pan_pos', `next_roi_pan_pos', `roi_pan_acceleration' and
     `roi_pan_max_ds_dt' members are relevant only if this is a
     metadata-driven animation frame with `num_clayers' > 0 and the
     previous animation frame has the same `frame_idx'.  In that case,
     `advance_animation' synthesizes multiple virtual frames in order to
     introduce an auto-pan preamble, whereby the view and ROI pans from
     those of the previous frame to those of the current frame.  Frames
     that are undergoing or have undergone an auto-pan preamble have their
     `roi_pan_acceleration' members set to a positive value.  If the
     auto-pan preamble is complete, `roi_pan_acceleration' remains
     non-negative but `cur_roi_pan_pos' equals 1.0, meaning that the pan
     has arrived at its final destination.  While a frame is undergoing
     an auto-pan preamble, its `display_time' and `cur_display_time'
     members are identical; both are incremented as the `cur_roi_pan_pos'
     member increases, to represent the display time associated with the
     start of the current segment within the pan preamble.  Once the
     frame has finished any auto-pan preamble, the `display_time' member
     is frozen, but `cur_display_time' may increase if conditional
     frame steps are executed.  Auto-panning is configured (and updated) by
     calls to `get_roi_and_mod_viewport'.

  /* Notes:
       This object is used to keep track of frames that have been (or are
     about to be) requested via a `kdu_client' object.  The reason for
     having a separate `kdra_frame_req' object, as opposed to just augmenting
     the `kdra_frame' object is that a given frame may be the subject of
     multiple non-consecutive client requests -- this can happen if the
     animation is to be looped (repeat mode).  Conceptually, the
     `kdra_frame_req' objects are used to build a list of consecutively
     requested frames that may occupy a limited segment of the `kdra_frame'
     list, but may also wrap around the complete sequence of `kdra_frame'
     list one or more times, like a spiral staircase.  The oldest
     element on the `kdra_frame_req' list that references any given frame
     is identified via the `kdra_frame::frame_reqs' member.  This oldest
     element may reference more recent entries on the `kdra_frame_req' list
     that reference the same frame, via its `next_in_frame' member.
        The head of the `kdra_frame_req' list always points to the current
     animation frame, or the head of the `kdra_frame' list if there is no
     current animation frame.  As the animation advances, the head of
     the `kdra_frame_req' list is removed, which adjusts the corresponding
     `kdra_frame::frame_reqs' member -- if `kdra_frame::frame_reqs' becomes
     NULL, it is possible for the frame itself to be removed by
     `kdu_region_animator::remove_frame'.
        `client_reqs' contains up to two pointers to `kdra_client_req'
     objects that represent pending client requests.  There can be up to
     two client requests for any given frame, which allows for the fact that
     the first request was aggregated with earlier frames, while the latter
     request may refer to just this frame -- this only happens where a
     sequence of closely spaced frames are followed by one with long duration.

  /* Notes:
        The animator object does not and should not try to implement any
     kind of control loop to regulate the timing behaviour associated with
     its interaction with `kdu_client'.  This is because the `kdu_client'
     object already implements its own disciplined machinery to try to
     satisfy the expectations of timed requests passed to its `post_window'
     function with non-zero `preferred_service_usecs' values.  The `kdu_client'
     object attempts to guarantee that consecutive timed requests will
     receive a cumulative service time that matches their cumulative
     requested service times, measured using the same timebase as
     `kdu_client::sync_timing' is invoked regularly.  That function is
     very important.  In the implementation here, `kdu_client::sync_timing'
     is passed a version of the next display event time (coming from the
     frame refresh machinery), that has been converted to microseconds and
     expressed relative to a common reference time -- we refer to this as
     the "reference display clock".  The `kdu_client::sync_timing' function
     keeps track of the reference display clock values and compares them with
     its own internal clock, transparently making minor adjustments to the
     preferred service times that are passed to `kdu_client::post_window'
     so that it can use its own internal clock to manage the timed requests
     while still meeting the expectations of the application.  The
     `kdu_client::sync_timing' function also returns the amount of time
     that it expects to lapse between the point at which it is called
     and the point at which the next request to be posted (assuming the
     caller will post one) first starts to get served.  This allows us to
     figure out how far ahead we need to post our requests and also
     whether we need to ask for smaller amounts of service time than would
     nominally be associated with the frame interval, so that the
     client-server communication can catch up with the display process.
     With these things in mind, we now describe the interpretation of the
     timing member variables here.
        The `cumulative_display_usecs' member essentially holds the
     reference display clock value corresponding to the point at which
     we expect the last frame (or fraction of a frame) associated with this
     request to finish its display.  This value is based upon the relevant
     `kdra_frame_req::expected_display_end' value (corrected for fractional
     frame requests), converted to a reference display clock value.  The
     value is evaluated at the point when the request is posted and is
     not updated in any way after that point, even though the expected
     display start/end times for frames may change as new information
     comes to light.
        The `cumulative_request_usecs' member holds the sum of all
     `requested_usecs' values from this request and all previous requests,
     since the request list was last empty. The commitment of the `kdu_client'
     object is to endeavour to achieve a cumulative service time for these
     requests which matches the `cumulative_request_usecs' value, although
     there will be delay.
        Note that the reference display clock's base offset is chosen such
     that `cumulative_display_usecs' would be 0 if the end time for a
     request's frames corresponded to the next frame display event time
     passed to `generate_imagery_requests' at the point when the request
     list was last found to be empty.
        Generally speaking, we want `cumulative_request_usecs' and
     `cumulative_request_usecs' to advance together, so we normally select
     the `requested_usecs' value that is passed to `kdu_client::post_window'
     simply by taking the difference between the current and previous
     request's `cumulative_display_usecs' values.  However, if the
     `kdu_region_animator::generate_imagery_requests' function determines
     that the client-server communication is running behind (based on
     information returned by `kdu_client::sync_timing'), so that its requests
     might not be served in time, the `requested_usecs' value is reduced by
     up to 50%.  Note that there is no ongoing closed feedback loop here --
     just a mechanism for initially asking for less data so that the service
     process can catch up with the needs of the independent display process.
        The `service_usecs' value keeps track of the amount of service time
     that a request has actually experienced.  The value is not used in a
     very comprehensive manner, but only to determine whether new service
     data is likely to have arrived from the request's frames -- this, in
     turn, may trigger the need for frame refresh events where a frame has
     a very long nominal display time.
        The `first_frame' and `last_frame' members may become NULL if all
     frames that were associated with a request are removed or associated
     with new requests. */
