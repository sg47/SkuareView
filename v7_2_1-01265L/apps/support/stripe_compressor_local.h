  /* Notes:
        The `stripe_rows_left' member holds the number of rows in the current
     stripe, which are still to be processed by this tile-component.
        Only one of the `buf8', `buf16', `buf32' or `buf_float' members will
     be non-NULL, depending on whether the stripe data is available as bytes
     or words.  The relevant member points to the start of the first
     unprocessed row of the current tile-component.
        The `ratio_counter' is initialized to 0 at the start of each stripe
     and decremented by `count_delta' each time we consider processing this
     component within the tile.  Once the counter becomes negative, a new row
     from the stripe is processed and the ratio counter is subsequently
     incremented by `vert_subsampling'.  The value of the `count_delta'
     member is the minimum of the vertical sub-sampling factors for all
     components.  This policy ensures that we process the components in a
     proportional way.
           The `simd_transfer' function pointer, along with the other
     `simd_xxx' members, are configured by `kdsc_tile::init' based on
     functions that might be available to handle the particular conversion
     configuration for a tile-component (or collection of tile-components) in
     a vectorized manner.
        `simd_grp', `simd_ilv', `simd_dst' and `simd_lines' work together
     to support efficient transfer from interleaved component buffers, but
     the interpretation works also for non-interleaved buffers.  They
     have the following meanings:
     -- `simd_grp' points to the last component in an interleaved group; if
        NULL there is no SID implementation; the `simd_transfer' function
        is not called until we reach that component.
     -- `simd_ilv' holds the location that the current image component
        occupies within the `simd_grp' object's `simd_dst' array -- the
        address of the current `kdu_line_buf' object's internal array should
        be written to that entry prior to any call to the `simd_transfer'
        function.
     -- `simd_lines' keeps track of
