  /* Notes:
        The `stripe_rows_left' member holds the number of rows in the current
     stripe, which are still to be processed by this tile-component.
        There are four buffer types that may be used, depending on the value
     of the `buf_type' member.  To facilitate generic manipulation of buffer
     pointers (without having to write code to cover each specific case),
     all buffer pointers are stored in an anonymous union and the two
     LSB's of `buf_type' are guranteed to hold log_2(bytes/sample).  Thus,
     the two LSB's of `buf_type' hold 0 for 8-bit sample buffers, 1 for
     16-bit sample buffers, and 2 for 32-bit integer and floating point
     sample buffers.
        The current buffer pointer (`buf8', `buf16', `buf32' or `buf_float'
     as appropriate), points to the start of the first unprocessed row of the
     current tile-component.
        The `remaining_buf_elts' member plays the same role as its namesake
     in `kdsd_component_state', with reference to the `buf8', `buf16',
     `buf32' or `buf_float' pointer that appears here -- this may have been
     offset.  The member is decremented by `row_gap' each time the relevant
     buffer pointer is incremented by `row_gap'.  In this way, the
     individual sample transfer procedures can determine whether or not
     a vector transfer might overwrite the buffer that was ultimately
     provided by the application.
        The `ratio_counter' is initialized to 0 at the start of each stripe
     and decremented by `count_delta' each time we consider processing this
     component within the tile.  Once the counter becomes negative, a new row
     from the stripe is processed and the ratio counter is subsequently
     incremented by `vert_subsampling'.  The value of the `count_delta'
     member is the minimum of the vertical sub-sampling factors for all
     components.  This policy ensures that we process the components in a
     proportional way.
        The `simd_transfer' function pointer, along with the other
     `simd_xxx' members, are configured by `kdsd_tile::init' based on
     functions that might be available to handle the particular conversion
     configuration for a tile-component (or collection of tile-components) in
     a vectorized manner.
        `simd_grp', `simd_ilv' and `simd_src' work together
     to support efficient transfer to interleaved component buffers, but
     the interpretation works also for non-interleaved buffers.  They
     have the following meanings:
     -- `simd_grp' points to the last component in an interleaved group; if
        NULL there is no SID implementation; the `simd_transfer' function
        is not called until we reach that component.
     -- `simd_ilv' holds the location that the current image component
        occupies within the `simd_grp' object's `simd_src' array -- the
        address of the current `kdu_line_buf' object's internal array should
        be written to that entry prior to any call to the `simd_transfer'
        function.
