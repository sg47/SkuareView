          `expansion_factor' -- this is the ratio of input sample spacing
          to interpolated sample spacing, where values > 1 correspond to
          expansion of the source data.  Specifically, the normalized bandwidth
          of the interpolation kernels is BW = min{1,`expansion_factor'} and
          the kernels are obtained by windowing and normalizing the function
          sinc((n-sigma)*BW), where sigma is the relevant kernel's centre of
          mass, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.  The window has region of support
          covering -2 <= n <= 3.
             The function additionally limits the BIBO gain of the generated
          interpolation kernels, in such a way as to limit overshoot/undershoot
          when interpolating step edges.  The limit is `max_overshoot'
          times the height of the step edge in question for expansion factors
          which are <= 1.  For larger expansion factors, the `max_overshoot'
          value is linearly decreased in such a way that it becomes 0 at
          the point where `expansion_factor' >= `zero_overshoot_threshold'.
          The way in which the maximum overshoot/undershoot is limited is
          by mixing the 6-tap windowed sinc interpolation kernel with a
          2-tap (bi-linear) kernel.  In the extreme case, where `max_overshoot'
          is 0, or `expansion_factor' >= `zero_overshoot_threshold', all
          generated kernels will actually have only two non-zero taps.  This
          case is represented in a special way to facilitate efficient
          implementation. */

       /* Call this function to prepare the internal `simd_kernels' array
          such that each entry in the array points to an appropriate kernel
          (array index identifies the centre of mass, in the range 0.0 to 1.0,
          in steps of 1/32), in accordance with the supplied `type', if this

          not already initialized) for use in resampling, returning a pointer
          to this kernel.  The interpretation of the `type' argument is as
          follows:
          [>>] `KDRD_SIMD_KERNEL_VERT_FLOATS' -- in this case `simd_kernels[i]'
               points to an array of `kernel_length' groups of 4 floats, where
               each group of 4 floats is identical, being equal to the
               corresponding coefficient from the original kernel.  The
               `simd_kernel_length' value in this case is identical to
               `kernel_length'.
          [>>] `KDRD_SIMD_KERNEL_VERT_FIX16' -- in this case, `simd_kernels[i]'
               points to `kernel_length' groups of 8 16-bit words, where each
               group of 8 words is identical, being equal to the corresponding
               fixed-point coefficient from the original kernel.  Again, in
               this case `simd_kernel_length' and `kernel_length' are identical.
          [>>] `KDRD_SIMD_KERNEL_HORZ_FLOATS' -- in this case, `simd_kernels[i]'
               points to `simd_kernel_length' groups of 4 floats, which
               together form 4 kernels q[n,m] (m=0,1,2,3; n=0,1,...), which
               are used to form four floating point outputs y[m]. Let R
               denote the reciprocal of the `target_expansion_factor' member.
                  If `kernel_length'=6 and R >= 1, the output y[m] is formed
               from the inner product \sum_n q[n,m]x[n+m-2]; in this case,
               q[n,0] is the interpolation kernel for the relevant shift, padded
               with trailing zeros, while q[n,m] is obtained by adding
               (R-1)*m to the shift (sigma_i) associated with index i, and
               positioning the start of the 6-tap interpolation kernel,
               corresponding to sigma = FRAC(sigma_i+(R-1)*m), at location
               floor(sigma_i+(R-1)*m), padding the unfilled positions with
               zeros.  Since R is strictly less than 3, sigma_i+(R-1)*m
               is strictly less than 7, so the start of the last kernel
               cannot exceed position 6.  This ensures that the aligned kernels
               all fit within 12 coefficients, so `simd_kernel_length' will be
               no larger than 12.  The `simd_horz_leadin' member will be
               equal to 2 for this case, reflecting the fact that the first
               sample required to form y[m] is x[n+m-2].
                  If `kernel_length'=6 and R < 1, the output y[m] is
               formed from the inner product \sum_n q[n,m]x[n+m-L], where L
               is the value of `simd_horz_leadin'; in this case, q[n,0] is
               the interpolation kernel for the relevant shift, padded
               with L-2 leading zeros.  q[n,m] is obtained by subtracting
               (1-R)*m from the shift sigma_i and positioning the interpolation
               kernel which has centre of mass sigma = FRAC(sigma_i-(1-R)*m)
               at location L - 2 + floor(sigma_i-(1-R)*m), padding the
               unfilled positions with zeros.  Since R > 0, sigma_i-(1-R)*m is
               strictly greater than -3, and the start of the last kernel
               commences at position L-5 or greater.  This means that L need be
               no larger than 5.  Note, however, that if R is close to 1, the
               value of L could be closer to 2, allowing smaller overall SIMD
               kernel lengths.  With the maximum value of 5 for
               L=`simd_horz_leadin', `simd_kernel_length' takes its maximum
               value of 9.
                  Otherwise we must have `kernel_length'=2 and R<1 (expansion).
               In this case, the output y[m] is formed from the inner product
               \sum_n q[n,m]x[n], where q[n,0] is the interpolation kernel
               for the relevant shift, padded with `simd_kernel_length'-2
               trailing zeros.  q[n,m] is obtained by adding R*m to the shift
               sigma_i and positioning the interpolation kernel which has centre
               of mass sigma = FRAC(sigma_i+R*m) at location floor(sigma_i+R*m),
               padding unfilled positions with zeros.  Since R<1 and m<=3, the
               `simd_kernel_length' value will never exceed 5.  However, for
               small R (large expansion factors), `simd_kernel_length' may be
               as small as 3.  Note that `simd_horz_leadin' is always 0 in
               this case.
          [>>] `KDRD_SIMD_KERNEL_HORZ_FIX16' -- in this case, `simd_kernels[i]'
               points to `simd_kernel_length' groups of 8 16-bit words,
               which together form 8 kernels q[n,m] (m=0,1,...,7; n=0,1,...),
               which are used to form 8 outputs y[m].  The approach is similar
               to that described above for the floating-point case, except that
               the equations are as follows:
                  If `kernel_length'=6 and R >= 1, the output y[m] is formed
               from the inner product \sum_n q[n,m]x[n+m-2] and q[n,m] is
               obtained by positioning the relevant 6-tap interpolation kernel
               at location floor(sigma_i+(R-1)*m), which cannot exceed 14.  In
               this case, the `simd_kernel_length' value will never be larger
               than 20, but could be as small as 7 in some cases.  For this
               case, as before, `simd_horz_leadin' = 2.
                  If `kernel_length'=6 and R < 1, the output y[m] is formed
               from the inner product \sum_n q[n,m]x[n+m-L] and q[n,m] is
               obtained by positioning the relevant 6-tap interpolation kernel
               at location L - 2 + floor(sigma_i-(1-R)*m).  In this case,
               `simd_kernel_length' takes a maximum value of 13 when
               L=`simd_horz_leadin' takes its maximum value of 9.  For values
               of R close to 1, L can be closer to 2 leading to SIMD kernel
               lengths which can be as small as 7.
                  Otherwise we must have `kernel_length'=2 and R<1 (expansion).
               In this case, the output y[m] is formed from the inner product
               \sum_n q[n,m]x[n], where q[n,0] is the interpolation kernel
               for the relevant shift, padded with `simd_kernel_length'-2
               trailing zeros.  q[n,m] is obtained by adding R*m to the shift
               sigma_i and positioning the interpolation kernel which has centre
               of mass sigma = FRAC(sigma_i+R*m) at location floor(sigma_i+R*m),
               padding unfilled positions with zeros.  Since R<1 and m<=7, the
               `simd_kernel_length' value will never exceed 9.  However, for
               small R (large expansion factors), `simd_kernel_length' may be
               as small as 3.  Note that `simd_horz_leadin' is always 0 in
               this case.

 /* Notes:
       The `target_expansion_factor' keeps track of the expansion factor for
    which this object was initialized.  The expansion factor may be less than
    or greater than 1; it affects both the bandwidths of the designed kernels
    and also the structure of horizontally extended kernels -- see below.
       The `derived_max_overshoot' value represents the upper bound on the
    relative overshoot/undershoot associated with interpolation of step edges.
    This is the value that was used to design the interpolation kernels found
    in this object.
       The `float_kernels' array holds 33 interpolation kernels, corresponding
    to kernels whose centre of mass, sigma, is uniformly distributed over the
    interval from 0.0 to 1.0, relative to the first of the two central
    coefficients; there are (`filter_length'-2)/2 coefficients before this one.
    The kernel coefficients are separated by `KDRD_INTERP_KERNEL_STRIDE' which
    must, of course, be large enough to accommodate `kernel_length'.  In the
    case where `kernel_length'=6, there are only 6 coefficients in this array
    for each kernel and so `kernel_coeffs'=6 and the last
    `KDRD_INTERP_KERNEL_STRIDE'-`kernel_length' entries in each block of
    `KDRD_INTERP_KERNEL_STRIDE' are left uninitialized.  In the case where
    `kernel_length'=2, it is guaranteed that `target_expansion_factor' > 1
    (the `init' and `copy' functions ensure that this is always the case) and
    the first 2 coefficients of the i'th `KDRD_INTERP_KERNEL_STRIDE'-length
    block hold the values 1-sigma_i and sigma_i, where sigma_i=i/32.0.  In
    this case, however, `kernel_coeffs'=14 and the remaining 12 coefficients
    of the i'th kernel block are initialized to hold kernels q[n,m] of
    length 3 (m=1), 4 (m=2) and 5 (m=3), such that taking the m'th successive
    output sample can be formed from y[m] = sum_{0 <= n < 2+m} x[n]q[n,m].
    These extra kernels correspond to shifts sigma_i+R*m.  This allows
    a direct implementation of the horizontal interpolation process to
    rapidly compute up to 4 outputs together before determining a new kernel. */

  /* Notes:
        Except in the case where no processing is performed and no conversions
     are required for any reason, the channel buffers maintained by this
     structure have one of three possible representations:
     [S] 16-bit fixed-point, with KDU_FIX_POINT fraction bits, is used as
         much as possible.  This representation is always used if there is
         a palette `lut' or colour conversion is required.  The `using_shorts'
         flag is set if this representation is employed.
     [F] 32-bit floating-point, with a nominal range of -0.5 to +0.5.  The
         `using_floats' flag is set if this representation is employed.
     [I] 32-bit integers, with the original image component bit-depth, as
         given by `source->bit_depth'.  This is the least used mode; it may
         not be used if there is any resampling (including boxcar
         integration).
     The value of `in_precision' is used to record the precision associated
     with `in_line' before any boxcar renormalization.  For the [F]
     representation, `in_precision' always holds 0.  If there is no
     boxcar integration, `in_precision' holds KDU_FIX_POINT [S] or
     `source->bit_depth' [I].  If there is boxcar integration, only the
     [S] or [F] representations are valid; in the latter case, `in_precision'
     is 0, as mentioned; for [S], `in_precision' is increased beyond
     KDU_FIX_POINT to accommodate accumulation with as little pre-shifting
     as possible, and the buffers are allocated with double width so that
     they can be temporarily type-cast to 32-bit integers for the purpose
     of accumulating boxcar samples without overflow, prior to normalization.
        The conversion from decoded image components to an output channel
     buffer (referenced by `out_buf') involves some or all of the following
     steps.  As these steps are being performed, each of `in_line', `horz_line'
     and `out_line' may transition from NULL to non-NULL and back again to
     keep track of the processing state.
       a) Component values are subjected to any palette `lut' first, if
          required -- the output of this stage is always written to an
          `in_line' buffer and `using_shorts' must be true.
       b) Component values or `lut' outputs may be subjected to a coarse
          "boxcar" sub-sampling process, in which horizontally and/or
          vertically adjacent samples are accumulated in an `in_line'
          buffer.  This is done to implement large sub-sampling factors only,
          and is always followed by a more rigorous subsampling process in
          which the resolution will be reduced by at most a factor of 4,
          using appropriate anti-aliasing interpolation kernels.  Note that
          boxcar integration cells are always aligned at multiples of the
          boxcar cell size, on the canvas coordinate system associated with
          the `source' component.
       c) If neither of the above steps were performed, but raw component
          samples do not have the same representation as the channel line
          buffers, or there are multiple tiles in the tile-bank, or horizontal
          or vertical resampling is required, the source samples are
          transferred to an `in_line' buffer.
       d) In this step, horizontal resolution expansion/reduction processing
          is applied to the samples in `in_line' and the result written to
          the samples in `horz_line'.  If no horizontal processing is required,
          `horz_line' might be identical to `in_line' or even the original line
          of source component samples.
       e) If vertical resolution expansion/reduction is required, the
          vertical filter buffer implemented by `vlines' is rotated by one
          line and `horz_line' becomes the most recent line in this vertical
          buffer; `out_line' is then set to a separate free buffer line and
          vertical processing is performed to generate its samples.  If no
          vertical processing is required, `out_line' is the same as
          `horz_line'.
       f) If `stretch_residual' > 0, the white stretching policy described
          in connection with `kdu_region_decompressor::set_white_stretch' is
          applied to the data in `horz_line'.  If the source
          `bit_depth', P, is greater than or equal to the value of
          `kdu_region_decompressor::white_stretch_precision', B, the value of
          `stretch_residual' will be 0.  Otherwise, `stretch_residual' is set to
          floor(2^{16} * ((1-2^{-B})/(1-2^{-P}) - 1)), which
          necessarily lies in the range 0 to 0xFFFF.  The white stretching
          policy may then be implemented by adding (x*`stretch_residual')/2^16
          to each sample, x, after converting to an unsigned representation.
          In practice, we perform the conversions on signed quantities by
          introducing appropriate offsets.  If white stretching is required,
          the [S] representation must be used.
       g) Once completed `out_line' buffers are available for all channels,
          any required colour transformation is performed in-place on the
          channel `out_line' buffers.  If colour transformation is required,
          the [S] representation must be used.
     [//]
     We turn our attention now to dimensions and coordinates.  The following
     descripion is written from the perspective that horizontal and vertical
     resampling will be required.  Variations are fairly obvious for cases
     in which either or both operation are not required.
     [>>] The `source_alignment' member records the effect of any image
          component registration offset on the shifts which must be
          implemented during interpolation.  These shifts are expressed
          in multiples of boxcar cells, relative to the `sampling_denominator'.
     [>>] `num_valid_vlines' identifies the number of initial entries in the
          `vlines' buffer which hold valid data.  During vertical resampling,
          this value needs to reach 6 before a new output line can be
          generated.
     [>>] The `sampling_numerator' and `sampling_denominator' members
          dictate the expansion/reduction factors to be applied in each
          direction after any boxcar accumulation, while `sampling_phase'
          identifies the amount of horizonal shift associated with the
          first column of `out_line' and the amount of vertical shift
          associated with the current `out_line' being generated.  More
          specifically, if the spacing between `in_line' samples is
          taken to be 1, the spacing between interpolated output samples
          is equal to `sampling_numerator'/`sampling_denominator'.  The
          phase values are set up so as to always hold non-negative quantities
          in the range 0 to `sampling_denominator'-1, but the notional
          displacement of a sample with phase P and denominator D, relative
          to the "nearest" `in_line' sample is given by
                  sigma = P / D
          The horizontal phase parameter is set so that the first sample in
          the `in_line' is the one which is nearest to (but not past) the
          first sample in `horz_line', while the vertical phase parameter is
          set up so that the third line in the `vlines' buffer is the one which
          is "nearest" to (but not pat) the `out_line' being generated.  Each
          time a new line is generated the `sampling_phase.y' value is
          incremented by `sampling_numerator.y', after which it is brought
          back into the range 0 to `sampling_denominator.y'-1 by shuffling
          lines in the `vlines' buffer and decrementing `num_valid_vlines',
          as required, subtracting `sampling_denominator.y' each time.
     [>>] In practice, we need to reduce the phase index P to an interpolation
          kernel, and we don't want to use explicit division to do this.
          Instead, we use (P + 2^{S-1}) >> S to index one of the lookup tables
          `horz_interp_kernels' or `vert_interp_kernels', as appropriate,
          where S, the value of `sampling_phase_shift', is chosen as small as
          possible such that 2^S > D/64.  The `sampling_numerator' and
          `sampling_denominator' values are scaled, if required, to ensure
          that the denominator is always greater than or equal to 32, unless
          this cannot be done without risking overflow, so as to minimize
          any loss of accuracy which may be incurred by the shift+lookup
          strategy for interpolation kernel selection.  After the quantization
          associated with this indexing strategy, some phases P which are close
          to D may be better represented with sigma=1.0 than the next available
          smaller value.  Thus, even though P is guaranteed to lie in the range
          0 to D-1, we maintain interpolation kernels with centres of mass
          which are distributed over the full range from 0.0 to 1.0.
     [>>] Each boxcar sample in `in_line' has cell size `boxcar_size.x' by
          `boxcar_size.y'.  In practice, some initial source rows might not
          be available for accumulation; these are indicate by
          `missing.y'.  Similarly, some initial source columns might
          not be available and these are indicated by `missing.x'.
          When a new line of component samples becomes available, the
          `missing.y' parameter is examined to determine whether this
          row should be counted multiple times, effectively implementing
          boundary extrapolation -- the value of `missing.y' is
          decremented to reflect any additional contributions, but we note
          that the value can be as large or even larger than `boxcar_size.y',
          in which case the boundary extrapolation extends across multiple
          lines of boxcar accumulation.  Similar considerations apply to the
          re-use of a first sample in each source line in accordance with the
          value of `missing.x'.  It is also worth noting that the `missing.x'
          and `missing.y' values may be negative if a channel does not actually
          need some of the available source component samples/lines.
     [>>] The `boxcar_lines_left' member keeps track of the number of source
          lines which have yet to be accumulated to form a complete
          `in_line'.  This value is always initialized to `boxcar_size.y',
          regardless of the value of `missing', which means that when
          initial source rows are replicated to accommodate `missing.y',
          the replication count must be subtracted from `boxcar_lines_left'.
     [>>] The `in_line_start' and `in_line_length' members identify
          the range of sample indices which must be filled out for
          `in_line'.  `in_line_start' will be equal to -2 if horizontal
          resampling is required (otherwise it is 0), since horizontal
          interpolation kernels extend 2 samples to the left and 3 samples
          to the right (from an inner product perspective), for a total
          length of 6 taps.  The `in_line_length' member holds the total
          number of samples which must be filled out for the `in_line',
          starting from the one identified by `in_line_start'.
     [//]
     The `stretch_source_factor' member is used only when responding to a
     call to the floating point `kdu_region_decompressor::process' function.
     It holds the ratio 2^B / (2^B - 1) where B is `source->bit_depth', unless
     white stretching or palette lookup is involved, in which case it is
     adjusted to represent the effective bit-depth associated with the
     target of any white stretching or palette lookup table.
