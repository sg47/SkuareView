         the supplied `initial_codestream' object; however, the sample
         precision and signed/unsigned properties of the data to be written to

         be consistent with the VIX file header which has already been
         written.
            Compressed video frames are sourced from `video', using either
         the sequential reading interface functions `video->open_image' and
         `video->close_image', or the concurrent reading features offered by
         `video->open_stream' in conjunction with `video->seek_to_frame'.
         The sequential approach is adopted if `io_queue' is NULL (see below).
         In this case `initial_codestream' is actually used as the first
         codestream (the caller should not destroy it) and there can be
         only one `kdv_decompressor' object in use.  If `io_queue' is non-NULL,
         the concurrent reading approach is adopted and `initial_codestream'
         is used only to initialize the internal parameters -- it should be
         destroyed by the caller, once all decompressors have been
         constructed.  In any event, destruction of the `initial_codestream'
         object is always the caller's responsibility to perform at some
         point.
            The `field_mode' argument has the same interpretation as that
         documented for the `kdu_compressed_video_source::set_field_mode'
         function.  In fact, if the content is interlaced, that function
         should already have been invoked with the same `field_mode'.  The
         field mode is explicitly needed only for concurrent reading
         operations, where `video->open_image' and `video->close_image'
         are not employed.  In particular if `field_mode' is 0, only the
         first field of each interlaced frame is processed, while if
         `field_mode' is 1, only the second field is processed, and if
         `field_mode' is 2, both fields are processed.  The `field_mode' is
         ignored for frames that are not interlaced.  It is worth noting
         that for elementary broadcast stream sources, it is possible for
         some frames to be interlaced and others not to be interlaced.  This
         object is designed to work correctly in such circumstances -- i.e.,
         each frame's interlaced/progressive attributes are tested separately.
         It is also worth noting that where there are two concurrent
         `kdv_decompressor' objects deployed to process alternate pictures
         from the source, they must both share the same `field_mode' value.
         The `load_frame' function's `fpnum' argument is used to resolve
         which particular field is to be loaded by each `kdv_decompressor'
         object -- i.e., this is not done by assigning one decompressor to
         work on the even fields and another to work on the odd fields, which
         would not work in the general case where some frames are interlaced
         and others progressive.
            The `discard_levels', `max_layers' and `region' arguments are
         used with `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions', each time
         a codestream is created or restarted at the start of a new frame.
         These same parameters should have been applied to the
         `initial_codestream'.  The `region' argument should be NULL if no
         restriction is to be applied to the decompressed region -- in any
         case any referenced `kdu_dims' object is copied internally for
         safety.
            The `load_compressed_data_to_memory' option is meaningful only
         when used with a non-NULL `io_queue' and when supported by the
         `mj2_video' source.  In this case, the entire compressed data for
         a video frame is loaded into memory by the `load_frame' function.
         This can lead to the highest possible throughput, but if you are
         only decompressing a tiny part of each video frame (e.g.,
         `discard_levels' might be quite large), it may be better to allow
         the codestream machinery to read compressed data on demand from the
         source, seeking to just those relevant locations -- `kdu_codestream'
         has many internal features to support reading the minimal amount of
         compressed codestream data.
            Frame data is decompressed into an internal frame buffer first
         (to emulate what would happen in a real application) and then
         written to the file identified by `store_fp'.  If `store_fp' is
         NULL, the file writing itself does not occur.
            If non-NULL, the `env' argument specifies a multi-threading
         environment to be used for multi-threaded processing, in place of
         the default single-processing implementation.  This is useful for
         accelerating the throughput on machines with multiple physical
         processors.
            The `double_buffering_height' argument is useful only for
         multi-threaded environments.  If non-zero, this argument is passed
         to `kdu_multi_synthesis::create' as the `processing_stripe_height'
         value, with `double_buffering' set to true.
            If `io_queue' is non-NULL, `env' must be non-NULL and the `video'
         object must implement the `kdu_compressed_video_source::seek_to_frame'
         and `kdu_compressed_video_source::open_stream' functions.  This is
         true for `jpb_source' and `mj2_video_source' derivations of the
         base `kdu_compressed_video_source' class, but it is not true for
         the `kdu_simple_video_source' derivation.
            The `io_queue' object is used to manage background load and
         flush operations on behalf of two concurrent `kdv_decompressor'
         objects. `io_queue->frame_processed' is called when
         `process_frame' completes and `io_queue->wait_for_io' is called
         when the main processing thread (the one associated with `env') calls
         `load_frame'.  Since source I/O on the `video' object involves
         concurrent access from multiple threads, it is important that the
         `jpb_source' or `mj2_movie' objects used to obtain the `video'
         interface were themselves opened using a `jp2_family_source'
         object that implements the `jp2_family_source::acquire_lock' and
         `jp2_family_source::release_lock' functions -- in practice, this
         is most easily accomplished by using `jp2_threadsafe_family_source'.
            The `frame_repeat' argument identifies the number of times each
         source frame is to be repeated.  Normally this argument is 0 (no
         repeats).  If > 0, each source video frame is used to generate
         `frame_repeat'+1 output frames, only the last of which is actually
         stored (if appropriate) to the output file.  Of course this only
         creates more work to do, without producing any more output; however,
         this allows I/O bottlenecks to be factored out when measuring
         video processing throughput, because frame repetition does not
         involve repeated loading of the compressed data for the frame or
         repeated storing of the decompressed results.

            In multi-threaded applications, the `caller' should always be
         non-NULL.
            If a non-NULL `io_queue' reference was passed to the
         constructor, the function will be called from a background thread
         to perform the actual frame loading, in which case the `caller'
         argument will identify the background thread and `in_io_job' will
         be true.  When called from the main processing thread (see
         `process_frame' for an explanation of what the main processing
         thread is), the `in_io_job' argument should be false, in which
         case the function simply waits for the background thread to finish
         loading the object's compressed frame data and storing any
         previously processed frame's image data -- these two activities
         should normally have already happened.
            As documented with the constructor, compressed frames are opened
         either sequentially, using `kdu_compressed_video_source::open_image'
         and `kdu_compressed_video_source::close_image', or concurrently,
         using `kdu_compressed_video_source::open_stream', together with
         `kdu_compressed_video_source::seek_to_frame'.  In the latter case,
         it is necessary for this function to know which frame should be
         opened.  In particular, the function has to know the index of the
         frame and, for interlaced content, the index of the field that
         should be opened.  This information is collectively managed by
         the variable referenced by the `fpnum' (read as "frame and parity
         number") argument, which must not be NULL if `io_queue' is non-NULL.
         Specifically, *`fpnum' holds P + 2*F, where P is the field parity
         (0 for the first field, 1 for the second) and F is the frame index,
         for the next image to be loaded.  Based on the prevailing
         `field_mode', *`fpnum' is adjusted if necessary to avoid loading
         a field that we are not interested in.  Before returning,
         the function adjusts the value of *`fpnum' to reference the next
         field of an interlaced frame (if `field_mode'=2) or to reference the
         first field of the next frame.  The caller keeps track of the
         state variable referenced by `fpnum', since this variable needs
         to be shared between multiple `kdv_decompressor' objects when an
         `io_queue' is being used.
      */
    void process_frame(kdu_thread_env *env);
      /* To process a frame, you should first invoke `load_frame' and check
         the return value.  If `load_frame' returned false, there are no more
         frames to process.  If `load_frame' returned ture, you then invoke
         `process_frame'.
            The compressed video source objects passed to the constructor may
         potentially still be in use by another `kdv_decompressor' object
         that is flushing its contents.  For this reason, you should not
         invoke `kdu_compressed_video_source::open_image' or
         `kdu_compressed_video_source::close_image' explicitly yourself.  The
         present function also takes care of invoking the
         `kdu_codestream::restart' function at appropriate points.
            We now discuss two usage scenarios for this function:
         1. If there is no multi-threaded processing environment, you
            pass NULL for `env'.  After this, you are responsible for calling
            the `store_frame' yourself.
         2. If there is a multi-threaded processing environment, you should
            generally invoke the function from the thread group owner,
            identified by the `env' reference.  In this case, the `store_frame'
            function is invoked automatically from a background thread, so
            long as a non-NULL `io_queue' argument was supplied to the
            constructor.

         display or a video analysis algorithm.

         gets called automatically from a background thread.  Otherwise, this
