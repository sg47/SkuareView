         `idx' member is related to the absolute codestream index of interest
         in the following way:
         1. If this is the top-level context-mapping object, `idx' is
            the absolute index of the codestream.
         2. Otherwise, if `idx' is less than `container->num_top_codestreams',
            `idx' is still the absolute index of the codestream.
         3. Otherwise, `idx'-`container->num_top_codestreams' is the relative
            index of one of the base codestreams defined by the container.
         The function returns NULL if it determines that `idx' is not valid.
