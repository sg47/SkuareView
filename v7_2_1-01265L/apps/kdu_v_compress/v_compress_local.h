     source file -- this is only to avoid clutter in the main
     "kdu_v_compress.cpp" source file.  The function sets things up so
     that video can be written to a JPX target.  To do this, the function
     does the following things:
     1. Copies all metadata and imagery from `prefix' to `tgt', being sure
        to copy any JPX containers as having a known number of repetitions.
     2. Verifies that the `prefix' file did actually have a top-level
        Composition box, since this is required.
     3. Creates a single indefinitely repeated JPX container (the associated
        interface is the function's return value) to represent the video
        content.  The JPX container has one base codestream, unless the
        video is interlaced, in which case it has 2.  For each base
        codestream, the container has N base compositing layers, where
        N is the number of separate descriptions provided by the
        `-jpx_layers' argument (N is 1 if there is no `-jpx_layers' argument).
        A container embedded metadata label is added to each base
        compositing layer for explanatory purposes.
     4. Configures the colour space for each added compositing layer, along
        with the codestream registration information.  By default, the
        colour space information is derived from `num_output_components' and
        `is_ycc', unless there is a `-jpx_layers' argument.

      /* The compressor object's structure and parameters are derived from
         the supplied `codestream' object, except that `num_src_components'
         is the number of image components that will be recovered from
         the source file and passed to `kdu_multi_analysis'.  If there is a
         Part-2 multi-component transform, this value might be smaller than
         `Mcomponents' and perhaps larger than the `Scomponents' attribute
         with which `codestream' was created.  After opening each tile,
         the `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest' function is invoked with
         the `num_src_components' value to let `kdu_multi_analysis' know
         which image components to expect across its `exchange_line'
         interface.
            If non-NULL, the `env' argument specifies a multi-threading
         environment to be used for multi-threaded processing, in place of
         the default single-processing implementation.  This is useful for
         accelerating the throughput on machines with multiple physical
         processors.
            The `double_buffering_height' argument is useful only for
         multi-threaded environments.  If non-zero, this argument is passed
         to `kdu_multi_analysis::create' as the `processing_stripe_height'
         value, with `double_buffering' set to true.
            If `io_queue' is non-NULL, `env' must be non-NULL and the
         `io_queue' is used to manage background load and flush operations.
         In this case, `io_queue->frame_processed' is called when
         `process_frame' completes and `io_queue->wait_for_io' is called
         when the main processing thread (the one associated with `env') calls
         `load_frame'.
            The `initial_frame_idx' argument identifies the index of the
         first frame to be processed by this object, while `frame_idx_inc'
         is the amount by which the frame index is incremented for each
         successive frame processed by this object.  It is not important that
         these correspond to real frame indices (there might be sub-sampling),
         but it is important that `initial_frame_idx' lies in the range
         0 to `frame_idx_inc'-1 and that compressors process frames in the
         same order as their `initial_frame_idx' arguments would suggest,
         where there are multiple concurrent processors.
            The `frame_repeat' argument identifies the number of times each
         source frame is to be repeatedly compressed, using exactly the
         same parameters.  Normally this argument is 0 (no repeats).  If > 0,
         each source video frame is used to generate `frame_repeat'+1
         compressed output frames, only the first of which is actually
         written to the output file -- the others are passed to a
         `kdu_compressed_target' object that simply discards its data.
         Evidently, frame repeats only create more work to do, without
         producing any more output; however, this allows I/O bottlenecks
         to be factored out when measuring video processing throughput. */
