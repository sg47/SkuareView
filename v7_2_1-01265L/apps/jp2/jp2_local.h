  /* Notes:
     If a single channel (luminance) colour space has been used, at most the
     `lum_curve' member will be non-NULL -- see below.
        All floating point matrices and offsets are based on the assumption
     that all channel samples have a nominal range from -0.5 to +0.5.  The
     actual channel samples may exceed this nominal range by some margin
     since (for example) 16-bit fixed-point quantities have nominally only
     KDU_FIX_POINT bits (current value of KDU_FIX_POINT is 13 bits).  In
     this case, no clipping is performed until the very end of the colour
     conversion chain, except where intermediate quantities must be clipped
     to avoid overflow problems.  Note that the nominal range from -0.5 to
     +0.5 means that the nominal level for zero intensity is -0.5, not 0.
     Note also, though, that some colour spaces have additional offsets and
     range reduction factors to allow for the representation of out-of-gamut
     colours.  For such colour spaces, the value associated with black might
     be larger than -0.5, but computation is performed for values over the
     full range from -0.5 to +0.5.
         Working with the floating point quantities only, for the moment,
     colour data is processed as follows to convert it to sRGB.
     First, we add the `opponent_offset_f' vector to the input colour vector
     (the vector has dimension 3).  Next, we multiply on the left by
     `opponent_matrix_f', interpreting the 9 values as a raster-scan of the
     3x3 inverse opponent transform matrix.  The values produced by this
     matrix represent channel primaries (usually gamma corrected) which are
     also in the range -0.5 to +0.5.  These are passed through the tone
     curves, which map the channel primaries to linear channel primaries,
     this time with a nominal range from 0 to 1.  The linear primaries are
     then multiplied on the left by `primary_matrix_f', which produces linear
     sRGB primary channels, again in the range 0 to 1, appearance corrected
     for D65.  Finally, the linear sRGB primaries are subjected to the
     standard sRGB tone reproduction curve.
        We now describe how the above operations are implemented in fixed-point
     arithmetic, and with integer lookup tables.  The channel samples are
     now interpreted as fixed-point quantities having KDU_FIX_POINT nominal
     fraction bits.  Thus, the integer value X must be divided by
     2^`KDU_FIX_POINT' in order to obtain the floating-point value x, which
     has the nominal range -0.5 to +0.5.
        The entries in `opponent_offset' are obtained by scaling the entries
     of `opponent_offset_f' by 2^`KDU_FIX_POINT'.  The entries of
     `opponent_matrix' are obtained by scaling the entries in
     `opponent_matrix_f' all by 2^12.  After integer multiplication and
     addition using these integer matrix quantities, the resulting integers
     should be divided by 2^12, leaving quantities with a nominal range
     from -2^{KDU_FIX_POINT-1} to +2^{KDU_FIX_POINT-1}-1.
        If `skip_opponent_xform' is false, the above operations can be skipped
     (offsets are all 0 and the matrix is the identity).
        If `use_ict' is true, the above operations represent the regular
     irreversible colour transform (ICT) of JPEG2000 Part 1 and so they
     are implemented by calling the (generally much more efficient)
     `kdu_convert_ycc_to_rgb' function.
        The `tone_curves' member contains one tone curve for each channel,
     although if any entry is NULL, the tone curve referenced by
     `tone_curves'[0] should be used.  Each tone curve behaves as a lookup
     table with 2^KDU_FIX_POINT entries.  The values produced at the output
     of the opponent transform serve as indices to these lookup tables, after
     the addition of 2^{KDU_FIX_POINT-1}. Values which exceed 2^KDU_FIX_POINT-1
     are clipped.   Negative values have their amplitude processed by the tone
     curve, while the sign information is preserved.  This allows out-of-gamut
     colours to be preserved, which is important for some colour spaces.
        The outputs of the tone curves have a nominal range from 0 to
     2^KDU_FIX_POINT-1, and the values of the `primary_matrix' are obtained
     by scaling the values of the `primary_matrix_f' matrix by 2^12. The
     outputs of that matrix are divided by 2^12, leaving integers with a
     nominal range from 0 to 2^KDU_FIX_POINT-1; again, values which are out
     of range may occur.  The outputs are clipped to KDU_FIX_POINT-bit
     unsigned integers and used as indices to the `srgb_curve' lookup tables,
     the outputs of which are signed fixed-point sRGB colour samples with
     KDU_FIX_POINT fraction bits, with a nominal range from
     -2^{KDU_FIX_POINT-1} to 2^{KDU_FIX_POINT-1}.
        If `skip_primary_transform' is true, none of the above operations are
     performed.
        If `skip_primary_matrix' is true, the `primary_matrix' transform
     is skipped and `srgb_curve' should be NULL.  In this case, the effects
     of the tone curves and srgb_curve are combined into the tone curves,
     whose outputs are signed fixed-point quantities with KDU_FIX_POINT
     fraction bits.
        The above transformations are applied only when producing transformed
     RGB data.  For luminance data, where `num_colours'=1, it is sufficient
     to do everything with a single lookup table.  In this case, the
     `lum_curve' array is used.  If this array is NULL, no transformation
     whatsoever is required.  Otherwise, we first add 2^{`KDU_FIX_POINT'-1}
     to the input samples, clip the resulting values to unsigned integers
     in the range 0 to 2^{`KDU_FIX_POINT'}-1, and use these as indices to
     the lookup table.  The output from the table is again a signed
     fixed-point quantity, with a nominal range from -2^{`KDU_FIX_POINT'-1}
     to +2^{`KDU_FIX_POINT'-1}-1. */
