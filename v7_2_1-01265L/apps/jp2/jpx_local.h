Description:
   Defines local classes used by the internal JPX file format processing
machinery implemented in "jpx.cpp".  The internal object classes defined here
generally parallel the externally visible interface object classes defined
in the compressed-io header file, "jpx.h".  You should respect the local
nature of this header file and not include it directly from an application
or any other part of the Kakadu system (not in the APPS/JP2 scope).

       This object is designed to occupy as little space as possible when

     the object is designed also to be able to identify codestreams that
     have been replaced by a JPIP incremental codestream equivalent
     placeholder.  Let LEN be the 48-bit unsigned quantity given by
     `length_low' + 2^32*`length_high'.  Then the following cases apply:
     -- If LEN=0, the object is considered empty, regardless of the
        other member values.
     -- If `url' lies in the range 0 to 0xFFFB (`JX_FRAGLIST_URL_MAX'), the
        object holds a single fragment, of length LEN, starting at location
        `frag_pos', within the file identified by `url' (0 means the main
        JPX file; other values are interpreted via the data-references box).
     -- If `url' = 0xFFFF (`JX_FRAGLIST_URL_LIST'), the `frag_list' member
        points to a list of fragments and LEN holds the total number of bytes
        covered by all fragments.
     -- If `url' = 0xFFFE (`JX_FRAGLIST_URL_FTBL'), the `box_pos' member
        holds the address of a Fragment Table Box that may still need to be
        parsed and LEN should be equal to 1.
     -- If `url' = 0xFFFD (`JX_FRAGLIST_URL_JP2C'), the `box_pos' member
        holds the address of a Contiguous Codestream Box that may still
        need to be parsed and LEN should be equal to 1.
     -- If `url' = 0xFFFC (`JX_FRAGLIST_URL_INCREMENTAL'), the object
        represents a JPIP incremental codestream equivalent placeholder, with
        logical codestream index `codestream_idx', and LEN should be equal
        to 1 or 2.  If LEN=1, the codestream's main header is not yet known
        to be complete, while if LEN > 1, the main header has been found to
        be fully available in the cache.
     Note that the `JX_FRAGLIST_URL_FTBL', `JX_FRAGLIST_URL_JP2C' and
     `JX_FRAGLIST_URL_INCREMENTAL' values cannot be set directly by an
     application and do not actually correspond to representations of
     Fragment List boxes.  Instead, these values are used in the
     implementation of `jx_source' to keep track of codestreams that have
     been "discovered" through encountering FTBL or JP2C boxes at the
     top-level of the file or within Multiple Codestream boxes.  If an
     FTBL box is encountered, it is kept in the `JX_FRAGLIST_URL_FTBL'
     form until it can be fully parsed (only relevant for JPIP services
     which send FTBL boxes directly).  If an incremental codestream equivalent
     placeholder box is encountered in any of the contexts in which an
     FTBL or JP2C box might be encountered, it is recorded using the
     `JX_FRAGLIST_URL_INCREMENTAL' code.

     the distance between the most recently parsed instruction and the
     latest instruction to which any parsed instruction's `next_use' field
     refers.
        If `next_in_track' is NULL, there are no more containers with
     presentation tracks.  Otherwise `next_in_track' points to the same track
     (or the last one, if there are not enough) in the next container that
     has presentation tracks.  Similarly, `prev_in_track' is NULL only for
     the top-level Composition box; otherwise it points to the composition
     object associated with the same track (or the last one, if there are
     not enough) in the previous container that has presentation tracks or
     to the top-level `jx_composition' object.  These members are filled in
     during JPX container finalization.
        The `last_in_track' member points to the last known object in the
     same track to which this one belongs.  This member is updated by
     following the `next_in_track' and, if necessary, `track_next' links,
     as far as possible.  These members are only advanced when they are
     actually needed and the need is experienced primarily within the
     top-level composition object.  The `max_tracks_noted' member is used
     in conjunction with `last_in_track' to determine whether or not the
     `propagate_frame_and_track_info' function may have missed some newly
     discovered tracks.

        The `next_identical' and `first_identical' members are used to build
     a list of all numlist nodes that are identical to one
     another -- their descendants, of course, may generally be different.
     The head of this list is identified via the `first_identical'

     `non_base_codestreams' and `non_base_layers' members are both > 0 and
     smaller than `num_codestreams' and `num_compositing_layers', respectively.
     However, this is rather unlikely.
        Only the `first_identical' numlist object is actually included in the
     doubly-linked lists managed by the `next_in_cluster' and `prev_in_cluster'
     arrays and only this object may have non-NULL entries in its
     `numlist_cluster' arrays.  Moreover, only the `first_identical' numlist
     can have a non-NULL `region_library'.
        If the head of the identical list is deleted, one of the other
     numlists in the identical list takes over its role.

  /* Notes:
        This object is used to build a library of numlist nodes -- i.e.,
     `jx_metanode' objects which represent a number list (and hence have an
     embedded `jx_numlist' object).  The purpose of the library is to
     facilitate fast access to metadata which is related to a specific
     codestream, compositing layer or the rendered result.  There is an
     analogous structure, `jx_region_cluster', which is used to build
     libraries of regions of interest; moreover, numlist clusters provide
     an efficient way of finding region of interest libraries which describe
     regions for specific codestreams, compositing layers, or the rendered
     result.
        The `jx_numlist_library' object maintains an array of FIVE pointers
     to top-level cluster lists (see `jx_numlist_library::libraries').  The
     five entries in this array correspond to `library_idx' values of
     `JX_LIBRARY_NLL', `JX_LIBRARY_C_NLL', `JX_LIBRARY_NLC',
     `JX_LIBRARY_C_NLC' and `JX_LIBRARY_NLR'.  These correspond to
     individual compositing layers (NLL), container-replicated compositing
     layers (C_NLL), individual codestreams (NLC), container-replicated
     codestreams (C_NLC) and rendered result (NLR).  The NLL and C_NLL
     libraries help to identify numlist nodes by the compositing layers with
     which they are associated.  Similarly, the NLC and C_NLC libraries help
     identify numlist nodes by the codestreams with which they are associated.
     Finally, the NLR library collects numlist nodes that are associated
     with the rendered result -- this one is degenerate, since there is no
     specialization to any image entities, but it is worth keeping in its
     own library for the sake of having a uniform encapsulation method.
        It is worth explaining briefly here the difference between the
     individual and container-replicated libraries.  Container-replicated
     libraries manage numlists that are embedded in JPX containers, where
     the numlist references at least one of the container's base compositing
     layers (C_NLL) or base codestreams (C_NLC).  It is possible for such
     numlists also to reference top-level compositing layers and/or
     codestreams, in which case they may also be found within the individual
     compositing layer (NLL) or codestream (NLC) libraries.  Numlists that
     are not embedded within a JPX container may still reference compositing
     layers or codestreams that are found within a container, but these are
     individual references (as opposed to references to all replicated copies
     of the container's base layers or codestreams).
        Each numlist library (i.e., each entry in the
     `jx_numlist_libaries::libraries' array) consists of a linked list of
     `jx_numlist_cluster' objects, all having `parent'=NULL, connected via
     their `next' links.  Each cluster in this top-level list has a distinct
     value for `log_range' and collects all numlist nodes whose "range"
     satisfies 2^{`log_range'} >= "range" > 2^{`log_range'-1}, where the
     value of "range" is determined as follows for each cluster type:
     -- NLL: "range" = 1 + <max comp. layer index> - <min comp. layer index>
     -- NLC: "range" = 1 + <max codestream index> - <min codestream index>
     -- C_NLL: "range" = 1 + <max container base compositing layer index> -
                             <min container base compositing layer index>
     -- C_NLC: "range" = 1 + <max container base codestream index> -
                             <min container base codestream index>
     -- NLR: "range" = 1
        The elements in the above-mentioned lists are termed root clusters.
     There is one root cluster for each log-range value within each library.
     The `range_min' and `range_lim' members in the root cluster store lower
     (inclusive) and upper (exclusive) bounds on the "start" value, where
     -- NLL: "start" = <min compositing layer index>
     -- NLC: "start" = <min codestream index>
     -- C_NLL: "start" = <min container base compositing layer index>
     -- C_NLC: "start" = <min container base codestream index>
     -- NLR: "start" = 0, but in this case, the entire library consists of
             just one cluster without any hierarchy or multiple log ranges.
        In each root cluster, the `range_min' and `range_lim' members store
     the tightest bounds that span all contained numlists (or all numlists
     that ever were contained at some point or other -- in case some have
     been removed, the `range_min' and `range_lim' values are not adjusted).
        If necessary, the root cluster will be recursively split into a list
     of `descendants', each of which have non-NULL `parent' members.  The
     descendants are also linked via their `next' members.  A cluster with
     non-NULL `parent' contains only those numlist nodes for which the "start"
     value satisfies:
         `range_min' <= "start" < `range_min' + 2^{`log_range'+`level'}
     The `range_min' values for non-root clusters must be multiples of
     2^{`log_range'+`level'}, while `range_lim' must be equal to
     `range_min' + 2^{`log_range'+`level'}+2^{`log_range'}-1.
        At the leaves of the cluster hierarchy where `level'=0 (the root of
     the hierarchy might be the sole leaf), the `numlists' member points to a
     doubly-linked list of `jx_numlists' objects, which belong to the cluster.
     The links in this list are found within the `jx_numlist::next_in_cluster'
     and `jx_numlist::prev_in_cluster' arrays of each entry in the list,
     at the entries corresponding to the cluster's `library_idx' value.
        As explained in the comments following `jx_numlist', only one out of
     each collection of identical numlists is actually linked into the
     library (this is the head of the doubly-linked list managed by
     `jx_numlist::next_identical' and `jx_numlist::first_identical'.

  /* Notes:
        This object plays an analogous role to `jx_numlist_cluster' but for
     regions of interest.  It is used to build a library of ROI nodes -- i.e.,
     `jx_metanode' objects which represent an ROI description box (and hence
     have an embedded `jx_regions' object).  The purpose of the library is
     to facilitate fast access to metadata which is related to specific
     regions of interest -- typically within specific codestreams and/or
     compositing layers.
        Each region library consists of a single `jx_region_library' object
     whose `jx_region_library::clusters' member points to a linked list of
     top-level clusters, connected via their `next' links.  The top level
     clusters have `log_size' values which decrease monotonically.  Under
     each such `log_size' root, all ROI nodes with the same log-size value
     are organized in hierarchical fashion, where the log-size value of
     an ROI node is the smallest integer R, such that 2^R is at least as
     large the width and the height of the ROI node's bounding box.  The root
     of a `log_size' hierarchy has the largest value for `level' and a NULL
     `parent' member; its `next' member connects it with the root of the
     next smaller `log_size' hierarchy.
        The `cover' member of any cluster identifies a region which completely
     covers all regions of interest that might be assigned to the cluster.  In
     the root cluster of each log-size hierarchy, this member stores the actual
     tightest covering region that spans all contained regions (or all regions
     that ever were contained at some point or other -- in case some have
     been removed, the cover is not adjusted).  If necessary, the root cluster
     will be recursively split into a list of `descendants', each of which have
     non-NULL `parent' members.  The descendants are also linked via their
     `next' members.  A cluster with non-NULL `parent' contains only those
     ROI nodes for which the upper left hand corner of the bounding box has
     (x,y) coordinates that lie in the range:
          `cover.pos'.x <= x < `cover.pos'.x + 2^{`log_size'+`level'} and
          `cover.pos'.y <= y < `cover.pos'.y + 2^{`log_size'+`level'}.
     The `cover.pos'.x and `cover.pos.y' members must themselves be
     multiples of 2^{`log_size'+`level'} and `cover.size.x' and `cover.size.y'
     will both be equal to 2^{`log_size'+`level'}+2^{`log_size'}-1.
        At the leaves of the cluster hierarchy where `level'=0 (the root of the
     hierarchy might be the sole leaf), the `regions' member points to a
     doubly-linked list of `jx_regions' objects, which belong to the cluster.
     The links in this list are found within the `jx_regions::next_in_cluster'
     and `jx_regions::prev_in_cluster' members of each entry in the list.
        There is one global (unassociated) region library, managed directly
     by the `jx_meta_manager' object; this is unlikely to be used, in practice,
     since ROI descriptions that are not associated with numlists are strongly
     discouraged (at least within Kakadu).  This unassociated region library
     has its `jx_region_library::representative_numlist' member equal to NULL.
        All other region libraries are associated with a specific number list.
     Rather than building a separate region library for each `jx_numlist'
     instance in the metadata hierarchy, we build one region library for
     all `jx_numlist' instances which specify exactly the same collection of
     codestreams and compositing layers (plus `jx_numlist::rendered_result'
     value).  These number lists are all connected in a list via
     their `jx_numlist::next_identical' members.  The head of this list is
     the one that points to the `region_library' for the collection.
        The `regions' list normally points to a list of `jx_regions' objects
     that are actually referenced by their respective `jx_metanode' owners.
     However, the list may instead contain copies of the original `jx_regions'
     objects -- this is useful when building temporary region libraries for
     structured writing of JPX metadata to file.  The copies are readily
     distinguishable from originals because the `jx_metanode' object
     referenced by `jx_regions::metanode' does not have its
     `jx_metanode::regions' member pointing back to the same `jx_regions'
     object.  Copies do not have their own `jx_regions::regions' array, but
     rather point to the original `jx_regions::regions' array.  Copies are
     necessarily short lived and are destroyed when the referencing
     `jx_region_cluster' is destroyed.

  /* Notes:
       This structure is used by `jx_scribble_converter' to represent an
     approximated scribble path.  Segments are connected either linearly
     or cyclically, via the `next' and `prev' members.  That is, `next' and
     `prev' form a doubly-linked list in which the first segment's `prev'
     member points to the last segment (if cyclic) or NULL, while the last
     segment' `next' member points to the first segment (if cyclic) or NULL.
        Each segment has an associated set of scribble points, which come from
     the shared array managed by the owning `jx_scribble_converter' object.
     For convenience, the location of this array is stored here as
     `scribble_points' and the number of available points is stored as
     `num_scribble_points'.  The points which are associated with the current
     segment have indices starting from `first_seg_point' and running
     consecutively for a total of `num_seg_points' points.  It is possible
     that these points have indices which wrap around back to the first entry
     in the `scribble_points' array, so the `get_point' function is provided
     for convenience.  You can be sure that each segment has a disjoint
     collection of associated points.
        A segment whose `is_line' and `is_ellipse' members are both false
     is being used to hold a range of scribble points which have not yet been
     fitted.  Otherwise, exactly one of `is_line' or `is_ellipse' is true.
        If `is_line' is true, `seg_start' and `seg_end' hold the end-points
     of the line segment which is approximating the associated scribble points.
     In the simplest case, `seg_start' and `seg_end' correspond to actual
     scribble points -- one of them will be associated with an adjacent
     segment, since scribble points are disjointly associated with segments.
     More generally, though, one or both of `seg_start' and `seg_end' may be
     modified so that the line segment is tangent to an adjacent elliptical
     segment.
        If `is_ellipse' is true, the ellipse is described by the
     `ellipse_centre', `ellipse_extent' and `ellipse_skew' parameters, which
     have the same interpretation as that used by the `jpx_roi::init_ellipse'
     function.  The `axis_extents' and `tan_theta' members provide an
     alternate interpretation of the ellipse, as returned by the second
     form of the `jpx_roi::get_ellipse' function.  Ellipses are obtained
     initially by fitting the set of associated scribble points -- an
     eigenvalue/eigenvector problem.  During this process, the set of
     associated scribble points is adjusted so as to obtain an ellipse which
     meets the various constraints.  Specifically, we grow the set of
     scribble points associated with the segment until all non-associated
     scribble points are found to be outside the ellipse.  We then assess the
     fitting constraints for the associated points and continue to extend
     the set of associated points until these fitting constraints are
     violated.  Once an ellipse is found, the set of associated points is
     trimmed back (if required) so as to ensure that the first and last
     associated points lie outside or on the ellipse boundary.  These first
     and last associated scribble points are projected to the ellipse and
     assigned to the `seg_start' and `seg_end' members.  Later, line
     segments can be connected to the ellipse at these end points.  However,
     for a smoother boundary, we can later explore further trimming away
     associated scribble points from the ellipse and projecting the first
     and last remaining scribble points to obtain new `seg_start' and
     `seg_end' values -- we can keep doing this until the attaching line
     segment becomes tangential to the ellipse (or nearly so).
        Note that an elliptical segment may not be adjacent to another
     elliptical segment, apart from itself -- this degenerate case
     corresponds to the entire scribble path being approximated by a single
     elliptical segment. */

     box has a box-type which is of interest to the meta-manager and its
     fragment list represents a single contiguous range of bytes from the
     same file, it might represent a link.  To investigate further,
     `jx_metaloc_manager::get_locator' is invoked with the location of the
     first byte in the fragment, and the `create_if_necessary' argument set
     to true.  The `metaloc' member is set to the returned reference, which
     has one of the following forms:
     a) `metaloc' references the target of the link, in which case
        `link' is set equal to `metaloc->target' and `metaloc' is set to NULL.
     b) `metaloc' is newly allocated, in which case the `metaloc->target'
        is set to `owner'.
     c) `metaloc->target' points to the `owner' of a `jx_crossref' object
        whose `jx_crossref::link' member is NULL and whose
        `jx_crossref::metaloc' member is identical to `metaloc'.  This means
        that case (b) occurred previously, so we add ourselves to the list of
        nodes waiting for the true target to become available, building this
        list via the `next_link' member.
       Once the `link' member is non-NULL, the `metaloc' member is set to
     NULL and the `link' object's `linked_from' member will point to the
     head of a list of `jx_crossref' objects which contain links to it, the
     `next_link' member being used to build this list.  Should the `link'
     object be deleted during an editing operation, all the linking nodes
     are also deleted.
       When saving metadata to a file, only those cross-reference
     nodes which contain links can be saved; the others are skipped.  A two
     pass approach is generally required.  In the first pass, the locations
     and lengths of every box to be saved are determined and the
     `jx_metanode::linked_from' lists are traversed to record this
     information in the linking nodes' `frag_list' box as a single fragment.
     Until this happens, the `box_type' member is set to 0, since the box
     type generally depends upon the way in which the link target is written
     anyway (actual node's box-type or else `jp2_association_4cc').  In the
     second pass, all the boxes (including links) can actually be written. */

  /* Notes:
        This object keeps track of all the information that is required only
     while parsing the `metanode' object or any of its descendants.  The
     `read' member is NULL once the contents of the node's box have been
     read, and all of its immediate descendants (if any) have been opened.
     However, this structure must persist until the metanode and all of
     its descendants have been completely parsed, as marked by the setting of
     the `JX_METANODE_IS_COMPLETE' flag.  The object is stored in the
     `jx_metanode::parse_state' member, which is deleted and set to NULL
     from within the `jx_metanode::check_parsing_complete' function.
        The `incomplete_descendants' member points to a doubly-linked list of
     immediate descendants of the object's metanodes that are currently
     incomplete -- i.e., that have non-NULL `jx_metanode::parse_state'.
     Members of the doubly-linked list are connected via their
     `incomplete_next' and `incomplete_prev' members.  Note that the list is
     not ordered in any particular fashion.  Doing so could be costly due
     to the way new incomplete metanodes are spawned from within generator
     nodes in an out-of-order fashion (see below).  Also, ordering the list
     could at most halve the search time for functions like `load_recursive'.
        The `is_generator' flag is set to true if the containing `jx_metanode'
     object exists for structuring purposes only; as its descendants are
     encountered, they are immediately promoted to siblings of the metanode
     (being placed immediately before it in the sibling list) until all
     descendants of the generator have been encountered -- once this happens,
     the generator is removed by calling `jx_metanode::remove_empty_shell'.
     Whenever a grouping box (`jp2_group_4cc') is parsed, it immediately
     becomes a generator.  Also, if `jx_meta_manager::flatten_free_asocs' is
     true, free-asoc boxes also become generators once detected.  A free-asoc
     box is an association box (`jp2_association_4cc') whose first sub-box is
     a free box (`jp2_free_4cc').  All generators are marked with the box type
     `jp2_group_4cc' and a `jx_metanode::rep_id' value of 0, in addition to
     having the `is_generator' flag set to true.
        The `num_possible_generators' member keeps track of the number of
     descendants of the current `jx_metanode' object which are either known
     to be generators or potential generators.  A descendant which is created
     from a `jp2_association_4cc' box, whose first sub-box has not yet
     become available, might be a generator if `manager->flatten_free_asocs'
     is true, because if the sub-box turns out to be a free box, that
     descendant will be marked as a generator, according to the definition
     given above.
        The last four members are used to provide additional information about
     any metadata-bin to which the metanode's box or asoc container belong.
     The node is said to have its own asoc container if it was created from the
     first sub-box of an association box, or if the node was created to
     temporarily hold the members of a grouping box -- in the latter case,
     the `jx_metanode::rep_id' value is 0.
        The `asoc_databin_id' and `asoc_nesting_level' members relate to the
     location of the header of the asoc container (i.e., asoc/group box), if
     any.  This information is used by `jpx_metanode::generate_metareq' to
     generate data-bin-relative metadata requests.
        If there is no asoc container, `asoc_databin_id' will be -ve.  If the
     asoc container is found at the top level of its databin, it will have a
     nesting level of 0.  If it is found at the top level within the contents
     of a superbox, which is at the top level of the databin, the nesting
     level will be 1; and so forth.
        The `box_databin_id' is always non-negative if the data is sourced
     from a dynamic cache.  If `box' is (or will be) found at the top level
     of its databin, it will have a nesting level of 0; and so forth.
        The `metanode_span' member holds the total number of bytes in the
     box which defines this node.  If the metanode is represented by an asoc
     container (i.e., a grouping box or an association box whose first
     sub-box yields the type of the metanode), then this member holds the
     length of the asoc container box.  In any case, `metanode_span'
     runs from the first byte of the header to the last byte of the box
     in question.  If the box in question has rubber length (very unlikely),
     the `metanode_span' value is -1.  If the object's metanode is actually
     the root of the metadata tree, its span corresponds to the entire

         of novel metadata, created by the application.

         practice, but it is possible that an application will enable
         interactive metadata editing directly within a `jpx_target' object,
         and that this application also wants to perform incremental
         generation of content and metadata, so that the
         `manager->last_unwritten_with_link_targets' member should not lag
         behind the last top-level metadata node that actually does have
         unresolved links.

         If you are using this function to insert a node whose box contents

         association box is encountered inside a codestream header box,
         compositing layer header box, or compositing layer extensions box.
            The `src' box need not be complete.  Its state is donated to the
         internal `asoc' or `box' member of a `jx_metaread' object which is
         created and assigned to the `read' object referenced by a newly

         The value of this argument is irrelevant if this box is not sourced
         from a dynamic cache.
            After calling this function, you should always invoke
         `finish_reading' and then check to see if `remove_empty_shell'
         needs to be invoked from the parent -- see `finish_reading' for more
         on this. */

         `JX_METANODE_BOX_COMPLETE' and the `JX_METANODE_CONTAINER_KNOWN' flags
         are set.  In the special case where `link_pos' is non-negative,
         the function stops trying to finish parsing the node's descendants
         once it encounters one whose original file position is greater than
         or equal to `link_pos'.  The function is called in this way only from
         within `load_recursive'.
            The function returns true when all reading of boxes at the
         top-level of the node is complete.  This does not mean that all
         descendants are yet known, because some of them might be found
         within "generator" nodes (see `jx_metaparse' for more on this).
         To ensure that all immediate descendants are known, we must at least
         finish reading all generators that are found as descendants of the
         node.  If, however, the function returns true when invoked on a
         generator node, the node should be empty, because the recovered
         sub-boxes are moved outside the generator as soon as they are
         detected.  This eventuality can be detected by checking for `rep_id'=0
         as mentioned below.
            After this function returns true, you should check to see
         if a generator node has been completely emptied.  This is readily
         done by checking `rep_id'=0 and `parse_state'=NULL.  If both
         conditions hold after the function returns true, the generator
         should be removed from its list of siblings by invoking
         `remove_empty_shell'.  This is left to the caller because
         we don't want to remove a node from within one of its own member
         functions.  Apart from the above condition, it is also possible
         that the object's `safe_delete' function has been invoked, in which
         case the node will no longer have any parent, descendants or
         siblings, but `rep_id', `box_type' and `flags' are still meaningful.
            The present function may legally be invoked on the root of the
         metadata tree, in which case the behaviour is rather different -- in
         that case the function attempts to parse whatever boxes remain from
         the top-level of the file, so as to recover all top-level nodes of
         the metadata hierarchy.  When invoked on the root of the
         metadata hierarchy, the function always returns false to prevent
         inappropriate calls to `remove_empty_shell' from being accidentally
         generated by the caller. */

         groups via the `jx_metagroup_writer' class, if there are a large
         number of them.  The function also treats ROI nodes specially;
         whenever an ROI descendant is encountered, it is immediately added
         to the `jx_metawrite::region_library'.  Once all other descendants
         have been written, the function writes ROI nodes from the library --
         if this is happening when we come back after premature return,
         `jx_metawrite::active_descendant' will point to an ROI node.
            If `super_box' is non-NULL, the function writes a sub-box of the
         supplied super box.  Otherwise, the function writes a top-level box
         to the `jx_target' object found in `manager->target'.
            The `file_pos' argument is used to keep track of the location
         to which each box is written (or would be written if we are
         simulating) within the file.  This is important for resolving
         cross references.  On entry to this function, `file_pos' refers to
         the first byte position at which any box header associated with
         this object will be written.  You should be careful to preserve
         the state of `file_pos' across multiple invocations of this function.

     box becomes available, the new sub-box is promoted as sibling of the

     of any "generator" node is encountered, that descendant is inserted
     the immediately preceding sibling of the generator node.  This policy
     ensures that the descendants of generator nodes are flattened during
     the reading process.  Generator nodes include grouping boxes and
     free-asoc boxes (association boxes whose first sub-box is a free box)
     if `manager->flatten_free_asocs' is true.
        Since grouping boxes' descendants are promoted to the level of their
     parents, we need to keep track of the number of descendants of a node
     which could potentially generate more descendants.  These include
     grouping boxes which are not yet completely parsed, as well as asoc
     boxes whose box-type is not known (could be of type `jp2_free_4cc')
     unless `manager->flatten_free_asocs' is false.  The number of such

  /* Notes:
       This object is used in conjuction with `jx_metaloc_block' and
     `jx_metaloc_manager' to manage location information for metanodes.
     Location information is kept for metanodes when they are obtained
     by reading from a file or a cache.  Location information is also
     kept when a metanode is created by copying from another metanode,
     which may belong to a different meta-manager.  Location information
     allows metanodes to be resolved from locations, which is particularly
     important when resolving links contained within cross-reference boxes.
       A location is identified by the `loc' member, as follows:
     -> For boxes found in a file, the `loc' member holds the location of
        the first byte of the box contents within the file.
     -> For boxes found in a cache, the `loc' member holds the location of
        the first byte of the box contents within its original file, as
        reconstructed from the relevant placeholder boxes.  This information
        can be obtained by adding the length of the box header to the value
        returned by `jp2_input_box::get_locator().get_file_pos()'.
     -> For metanodes obtained by copying other metanodes, the `loc'
        member holds the address of the relevant `jx_metanode' object,
        cast as an integer (usually a 64-bit integer, unless kdu_long is
        defined to be 32-bits, which is highly unlikely).
       For metanodes which are associated with an asoc box read from a file
     or cache, there are two separate locators: one for the first byte of
     the contents of the asoc box; and one for the first byte of the
     contents of its first sub-box (the one which gives the metanode its
     type).
       In some cases, the `target' of a locator may not be known.
     This happens when a link (represented by a cross-reference box) is
     encountered and the metanode (if copied) or box (if read) to which it
     refers is not yet available.  In this case, a `jx_metaloc' locator
     is added as the target of the link with a NULL `target' member, to be
     filled in once the associated metanode is discovered and associated
     with the locator.
       The `target' member can also take on the special, value of
     `JX_METALOC_IS_BLOCK', which is neither a valid address, nor NULL.
     In this case, the `loc' member refers to the first
     location represented by an ordered block of locators or sub-blocks.
     See `jx_metaloc_block' for an explanation of how an efficiently
     searchable and expandable tree of meta-locators is built using this
     mechanism. */

  /* Notes:
       This object provides the mechanism to build an efficient structure for
     searching and dynamically updating meta-data locators.  The structure
     is a tree, in which each node has up to JX_METALOC_BLOCK_DIM branches.
     The actual number of branches is recorded in the `active_elts' member
     and the addresses of the branches are stored in the `elts' array.  Each
     branch in the `elts' array may point either to a `jx_metaloc' object
     (a leaf in the tree) or another `jx_metaloc_block' object (i.e.,
     a node with further branches).  You can readily rearrange the branches
     in a block to insert new locations or blocks of locations.  The
     allocation and deallocation of `jx_metaloc' and `jx_metaloc_block'
     objects is handled by `jx_metaloc_manager' in a manner which avoids
     excessive memory fragmentation or excessive calls to new and delete.
     To determine whether an element referenced by the `elts' array can
     be cast to type `jx_metaloc_block', you have only to test its type via
     the `jx_metaloc::is_block()' convenience member function. */

         function determines whether or not a collection of size
         `collection_bytes' can be accommodated within the span of the
         current level or any of its sub-levels.  If so, the function returns
         the file address at which we expect to write the collection; if
         not, the function returns -1.
            It is important to realize that `jx_meta_target_level' objects
         are created initially in an uncommitted state.  That means that no
         box has been written to the file and so `box_start_pos',
         `content_bytes', `committed_bytes', `header_length' and
         `num_committed_groups' members will all be 0.  It may be that the
         current level has been committed -- meaning that a box has been
         written and closed again, having a fixed size -- but an internal
         `group' member has not yet been committed.  If the `commit' argument
         is true, the caller is requesting any uncommitted boxes to be written
         and closed.  When this happens, the `box_start_pos', `content_bytes'
         and `header_length' members of the newly committed object become
         non-zero and the committed box's total size shows up as
         `committed_bytes' within any containing `jx_meta_target_level' object;
         that object's `num_committed_groups' member is also augmented at
         that time.
            This function is recursive, in the sense that it descends into
         `group' members as required.  Moreover, the `commit'
         request is applied recursively.  If an existing committed `group'
         descendant cannot acommodate the `collection_bytes', the function
         detetes it, possibly creating a new one.  If there is no `group'
         descendant and the function determines that the current level
         should be arranged into groups, each with its own
         `jx_meta_target_level', the first such `group' is created, but
         left in the uncommitted state, unless `commit' is true.
            The `preferred_level_bytes' and `expected_start_pos' arguments
         are ignored if the current object has already been committed;
         otherwise, these are used to deduce the location, header length
         and contents length that would (or will) be used for this object
         when it is committed.  An object cannot be committed until its
         `parent' is already committed. */

         and the others are expected to have `typical_collection_bytes'.
         The preferred arrangement involves decomposing the remaining
         content bytes into groups of collections.  The function returns
         the expected size of the first such group which itself might be
         composed of further groups.

         sized with the idea that a level should hold 2 to 8 groups
         in total.  The function is guaranteed that `num_committed_groups'
         will be no larger than 7.
            As a convenience, if the function determines that the preferred
         number of elements in the next group is 1, it returns exactly
         `collection_bytes'; otherwise, if it determines that the preferred

         are bound to report different locations such that this function

     write (or commit) content to the file while reserving space within
     a hierarchy of grouping boxes for further content to be written from
     subsequent collection phases.  This is valuable for applications
     which write metadata incrementally (e.g., after each frame of a video
     sequence has been compressed and written), since it allows the
     metadata to be written immediately without polluting the top level
     of the file (or even lower levels) with a large number of sibling boxes.
     Flat lists of boxes at any level of the file can dramatically reduce
     the efficiency of random access, especially in remote interactive

  /* Notes:
        This object keeps track of the hierarchical organization found within
     J2CX (Multiple Codestream) boxes; individual objects of this class are
     kept in linked lists from which they can be removed and deleted once
     their contents have been fully parsed out.
        The `head' and `tail' members maintain a doubly-linked list of
     descendants, which may contain holes and need not be complete, either
     because random access information has allowed us to recover the
     descendants out of order, or because one or more descendants have been
     fully parsed and subsequently deleted.  The idea is that one only needs
     to access this structure if a codestream is found to be missing from
     the global array maintained within `jx_source' -- if a descendant has
     been fully parsed and removed from the list headed by `head', its
     codestreams must al be in that array so there will be no cause for
     attempting to recover it again.
        Initially, `first_subbox_offset' is set to 0.  As soon as the J2CI
     sub-box is opened (even if its contents are not yet available), the
     value of this member is initialized either to -1 (if we are reading from
     a dynamic cache) or to the length of the J2CI box.
        The `j2ci_box' member only appears open if the J2CI box could not be
     completely parsed at the point when it was discovered.  In this case,
     we must be reading from a dynamic cache and `first_subbox_offset' must be
     -ve.  Further sub-boxes of the main J2CX box can be opened sequentially,
     because `j2ci_box' is a transplant.
        Sub-boxes may be parsed from the main J2CX container either
     sequentially or randomly, depending on available information.
     Specifically, for random access to sub-boxes, `first_subbox_offset'
     must be positive and `streams_per_subbox' and `bytes_per_subbox' must
     both be non-zero.  These last two members are recovered from the J2CI
     box's Ltbl field, if non-zero.  In this case, `num_descendants'
     is calculated as the number of sub-boxes that are expected to
     contain codestreams.  Otherwise, `num_descendants' is 0 and
     sub-boxes are opened sequentially.  When `num_descendants' and
     `streams_per_subbox' are both greater than 1, the `descendants' array
     is created to keep track of all descendants that have been opened but
     are not yet completely parsed (these are the ones with non-NULL entries).
        If sequential parsing is to be used, the `next_subbox_min_id'
     holds the min_id value that will apply to the next sub-box to be opened
     within the main J2CX box, unless the number of codestreams in the `tail'
     object cannot yet be determined, in which case `next_subbox_min_id' holds
     the same value as `tail->min_id'.
        Once a sub-box is opened (randomly or sequentially), it is either
     transplanted to a new descendant, or else it is transplanted directly
     to a `jx_codestream_source' object managed by our `owner' -- which
     action is taken depends on the box type.
        Once a sub-box is transplanted to a `jx_codestream_source' or a
     descendant becomes fully recovered and removed, the associated number of
     codestreams is added to the `fully_recovered_streams' count.  This value
     is used to implement the present object's `check_fully_recovered'
     function.

                               jp2_output_box **access_jclx);
      /* This function serves a range of purposes.  Its basic intent is to
         open a JCLX box and fully write the box's contents, except for
         any embedded metadata.
            The function may be invoked directly from
         `jpx_target::write_headers', in which case the `access_jclx'
         argument will be NULL.  It may also be invoked from within
         `jx_target::write_or_simulate_earlier_containers', in which case
         `access_jclx' will also be NULL.  In both of these cases, the
         base `first_metanode' and `last_metanode' members must be NULL --
         that is, these forms of invocation are only for writing the JCLX
         box of a container that has no embedded metanodes.  Also in these
         cases, the JCLX box is closed if the function succeeds (NULL return).
         As with all interruptable content generation functions, the
         function may return prematurely if it encounters an application
         installed breakpoint, in which case the breakpoint details will be
         written to `i_param' and `addr_param', and the function returns a
         pointer to an open `jp2_output_box' into which the application may
         write any extra sub-boxes of interest.
            The function may also be invoked from within `jx_metanode::write'
         when container-embedded metadata is encountered.  In this case,
         `access_jclx' will be non-NULL.  The function again attempts to
         write all relevant content, except for the embedded metadata,
         returning prematurely with a non-NULL `jp2_output_box' pointer if
         an application-defined breakpoint is encountered.  In this case,
         however, the function leaves the JCLX box open and returns a pointer
         to it via the `access_jclx' argument so that it can be used to write
         embedded metadata.  Once the function returns NULL, such metadata
         writing can occur and the function can be called over and over again,
         each time returning the open JCLX box via `access_jclx', until the
         caller eventually finishes writing all metadata and closes the box
         itself.  In this specific case, the function always invokes
         `jx_target::write_or_simulate_earlier_containers' first, so as to
         ensure that any JPX containers without embedded metadata that fall
         between two containers that do have embedded metadata (both needing
         to be simultated and then written to fill in link metanode target
         addresses) will get incorporated into the metadata-driven simulation
         and writing process.
            Before this function is called, it is important that `finalize'
         has already been called (this is done through
         `jx_targt::finalize_all_containers', that is invoked as necessary
         from `jpx_target::write_headers' and `jpx_target::write_metadata'
         before they reach a point where the present function might be called.
            The `simulation_phase' argument may be non-zero if this function
         is called from `jx_metanode::write' or from
         `jx_target::write_or_simulate_earlier_containers'.  In this case,
         whenever a JCLX box is opened, the `simulation_phase' value is
         passed to `jx_target::open_top_box'.  The object remembers internally
         whether or not it is in the midst of a simulated write so that it
         can reset relevant state variables when the `simulation_phase'
         changes.
            If `file_pos' is non-NULL, it is used to store the location
         in the file at which data is to be written.  It is assumed that
         call calls from `jx_metanode::write' to this function provide a
         reference to exactly the same `file_pos' variable, so that the
         function can accumulate information in that variable. When the
         JCLX box is first opened its location is stored in `file_pos';
         later, when the function first completes the generation of all
         relevant boxes (not including any embedded metanodes), it invokes
         `jx_target::note_jclx_written_or_simulated' and augments the value at
         `file_pos' by the total number of bytes that have been written,
         so that if the caller adds new sub-boxes, it knows the location
         at which they are being written.

     arrives, the call is passed recursively to that object.  Otherwise, the
     function evaluates whether or not a subordinate `multi_sub' object
     should be created.
        The `next_subbox_offset' and `out_box_len' values are 0 from the point
     at which `init' is called until `close_boxes' or `finish' is called.
     Thereafter, `out_box_len' is guaranteed to hold the total body length of
     `out_box' (i.e., not including its header) and `next_subbox_offset' holds
     the offset from the start of the body of `out_box' to the start of the
     free sub-box (if any) that occupies pre-allocated yet unwritten bytes
     within the `out_box'.  These bytes will be overwritten by calls to
     `write_stream_ftbl' that arrive after `close_boxes' is called.
        The `streams_per_subbox' value is set by `init' and then remains
     fixed, no matter what.  This is the number of codestreams that we will
     attempt to include in any sub-box written after the J2CI sub-box,
     except possibly the last one.  If this value is 1, all sub-boxes are
     FTBL boxes.  Otherwise, all sub-boxes (except possibly the last one)
     are J2CX boxes for which an `multi_sub' object is required.
        The `bytes_per_subbox' value is initialized to 0.  It becomes non-zero
     when the first sub-box is completed.  Subsequently if any sub-box takes
     a different number of bytes (other than the last one) or a different
     number of streams, due to changes in the number of bytes required to
     represent an FTBL, the value is set to -1 to mark this condition. */
