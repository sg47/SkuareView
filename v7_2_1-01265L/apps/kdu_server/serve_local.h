  /* Notes:
        This structure is used to build a list of active data-bins for each
     window context (see `kd_window_context'), identifying the data-bins for
     which information can be generated by
     `kd_context_window::generate_increments'.
        The `stream' member must be non-NULL for any codestream-related
     data-bin -- i.e., anything other than a meta data-bin.  If `stream'
     is non-NULL, but `tile' and `precinct' are both NULL, the data-bin in
     question is the codestream's main header data-bin.
        The `log_relevance' value is used to determine a priority for
     sequencing data from this data-bin during calls to
     `kd_window_context::generate_increments'.  For precinct data-bins, this
     value represents 256 * the log of the precinct's relevance fraction,
     which is essentially the fraction of the precinct's total samples which
     overlap with the client's window of interest -- the value is always <= 0.
     For tile and codestream header data-bins, this value is always equal
     to 65535, which ensures that these data-bins always get sequenced
     first, no mattter what.  For meta data-bins, the value is derived from
     `kd_meta::sequence', together with the absolute priority of the metadata
     portion of the relevant window request.  If the metadata is requested
     with absolute priority, it is assigned a `log_relevance' value of 65535.
     Otherwise, the value may be smaller.  When determining incremental
     contributions for precinct data-bins, the
     `kd_window_context::simulate_increments' function adds `log_relevance'
     to the relevant `kd_stream::active_layer_log_slope' entry before
     comparing with the current value of `kd_window_context::active_threshold'.
     However, for non-precinct data-bin references, the `log_relevance' value
     is compared directly with `kd_window_context::active_threshold'.
        The `num_active_bytes' member refers to the total number of bytes for
     the data-bin (starting from the first byte of the data-bin) which are
     relevant to the window context -- this value is of interest only for
     meta data-bins.
        The `num_active_layers' member refers to the total number of quality
     layers (or packets) for a precinct data-bin, which are relevant to the
     codestream window being generated this data-bin reference.

  /* Notes:
        This structure is used to build a list of delivered data-bins for
     each `kds_chunk' object which contains a generated chunk of data to be
     delivered to a client.  This list can be used to restore the cache model
     to a suitable state in the event that the chunk of data is abandoned
     in the future.
        To understand this structure, you first need to appreciate that data
     chunks generated via `kdu_serve::generate_increments' might subsequently
     be abandoned by the client-server communication protocol.  When the
     abandoned chunks are returned via `kdu_serve::release_data_chunks', the
     nominal response is to adjust the cache model so as to reflect the fact
     that the data was not actually delivered.  The current object certainly
     records enough state information to ensure that this can be done.  In
     practice, however, when delivering content over an unreliable channel,
     it can (and frequently does) happen that the abandoned data chunk
     contains information which represents a gap in the range of bytes
     delivered for some particular data-bin.  If we just updated the cache
     model for such a data-bin, all record of successfully delivered data
     beyond the gap would be obliterated, leading to redundant retransmission
     in the future.  To minimize the likelihood that this occurs, the
     `kdu_serve' object is prepared to retain some or all of the abandoned
     data chunks' byte ranges as "holes" within the cache model, regenerating
     the associated content within `kd_window_context::generate_increments',
     whenever it turns out to be relevant to a window.  To facilitate this
     process.
        `prev_bytes' refers to the number of bytes from the data-bin which
     were in the client cache model prior to the generation of increments
     which resulted in the construction of the data chunk with which this
     object is associated.
        `num_bytes' refers to the number of bytes from the data-bin which
     are/were contained in the data chunk with which this object is
     associated.  This value can be used to implement the strategy discussed
     above, whereby we first detect whether the abandoned data represents a
     hole in the cache model (or just the tail of some byte range) and then
     later (potentially) regenerate the missing data to satisfy future
     increment generation efforts.

         requests to determine whether or not a metadata group should be
         considered in scope and, if so, how much of it is in scope.
         Otherwise, everything which can be considered relevant to the
         window region is considered in scope.  When evaluating the scope,
         `first_window' is considered to be the head of a list of active
         codestream windows for some window context, which is traversed up
         until, but not including, the point at which `lim_window' has been
         encountered -- if `lim_window' is NULL, the entire list is traversed
         from `first_window'.
            If the `phld' member is non-NULL, the function recursively passes
         through the metagroup list associated with the placeholder,
         evaluating the scope and sequence of those elements.  If any
         are in scope, the present object must also be brought into scope
         and its sequence priority adjusted to be at least as low (low
         sequence means high priority) as that of the in-scope placeholder
         elements.  Once an in-scope element is found, the function also
         scans backwards through the list of elements which belong to the
         same data-bin, setting them all to be in scope, with sequence
         numbers no larger than that found for the current element.  This
         is important since data-bins are delivered in linear fashion.
            The `max_sequence' argument limits the maximum value for the
         `sequence' member of this node.  This is set to a non-trivial value
         if the containing box is requested in a manner which also requires
         content from its descendants.
            If `accumulated_byte_limit' is non-NULL, at least some bytes
         from the current node are requested.  The number of bytes from this
         node's box contents is given by *`accumulated_byte_limit' and the
         current function must decrement *`accumulated_byte_limit' by the
         number of bytes it is actually able to contribute (including bytes
         contributed by its descendants).
            If `recursion_depth' is >= `tree_depth', the headers of all
         boxes found at the top level of this node are required.  When
         the function is invoked on the root of the metadata tree, the
         value `recursion_depth'=0 ensures that all box headers found within
         meta-databin 0 are forced in scope -- something required by the
         JPIP standard.  The value of `recursion_depth' is increased to the
         `dynamic_depth' of any recursive metareq instruction which brings
         the current node into scope -- and this increased recursion depth
         is passed down to our descendants.
            The function returns true if it places any metagroup in scope
         which has a non-NULL `link_target' member.  This means that once
         the recursive function has completed, we will have to invoke
         `add_active_link_targets_to_scope' prior to invoking the
         `include_active_groups' function. */

         descendants which are `in_scope', looking for any which have a

         with its containing metagroups and previous sibling metagroups.
         In the process of doing this, we can be sure that we will not
         add any metagroup into scope which itself has a non-NULL `link_target'
         (that would require iterative re-application of this function).  The
         reason we can be sure of not doing this is that non-NULL

         contents of cross-reference boxes, but no other cross-reference
         box may point into a cross-reference box, and the contents of each
         cross-reference box are assigned their own data-bin so that there

         non-NULL, it is possible that the caller needs to make `start'
         reference the current object.  The implementation needs to be
         aware of this possibility to avoid creating self-referential loops.

     which contain the linked location.
        To assist in the implementation of temporary cache models for
     processing of stateless requests, the `is_modeled' and `next_modeled'
     members are provided.  The `is_modeled' member becomes non-zero when
     the `kd_meta' object is first referenced by a `kd_active_binref' entry.
     At that point also, the `is_modeled' flag is set to true for all
     `kd_meta' objects which belong to the same meta data-bin, and the
     last `kd_meta' object in the data-bin (the one with `can_complete'
     non-zero) is linked into the `kd_serve::modeled_metabins' list via its
     `next_modeled' links.  Each time a new stateless request is about to be
     processed (or one has been fully processed), the entire list of modeled
     `kd_meta' objects is disassembled, resetting the `is_modeled' flags to 0
     and also resetting the cache model values to reflect an empty cache model.
     The `is_modeled' status also allows the internal machinery to determine
     whether cache model manipulation instructions have already been applied
     to a `kd_meta' object so that they need not be applied again.  This is
     important, because `kd_meta' objects might be visited multiple times
     during successive calls to `kd_window_context::sequence_active_bins' and
     we only want to apply cache model manipulation instructions once -- this
     is easy to do for atomic instructions, but stateless requests may use
     non-atomic instructions which apply to a range of data-bins and cannot
     generally be erased as they are applied.
        The cache model state of this object is managed by `dispatched_span',
     `span_complete' and `dispatched_holes'.  The `dispatched_span' holds
     the range of bytes, from the start of this `kd_meta' object's byte range
     (not necessarily the start of the meta data-bin) until the last byte
     for which data increments have been generated.  Some of this information
     may have been abandoned, in which case there may be some
     `dispatched_holes' within the span.  The `span_complete' member is
     non-zero only if the `dispatched_span' includes the last byte of the
     meta data-bin and this fact has been communicated via the
     inclusion of an end-of-databin flag within a generated data increment.
     Of course, this means that `span_complete' will never be non-zero if
     `next_in_bin' is non-NULL.  It is worth noting that the
     `kd_model_hole::start' and `kd_model_hole::lim' members in the
     `dispatched_holes' list identify ranges of bytes (holes) relative to
     the start of the byte range represented by this `kd_meta' object, which
     may not be the start of its meta data-bin.
        The `sim_span' and `sim_span_complete' members record the state of
     the `kd_context_window::simulate_increments' function; after the
     simulated increments have been generated, these members are used to
     update the cache model state members.  The `sim_span_complete' member
     holds the value which will be assumed by `span_complete' after
     increment generation. `sim_span' is a little trickier.  After increment
     generation, `dispatched_holes' will be truncated or removed if they
     lie within the first `sim_span' bytes associated with this `kd_meta'
     object, while `dispatched_span' will be increased to `sim_span' if
     `sim_span' is greater than `dispatched_span'.

         to the returned tile's `close' function -- although this is not
         strictly necessary.  Do not invoke `kdu_tile::close' directly on

  /* Notes:
        `kd_stream' maintains various kinds of information for a single
     codestream.  In particular, it maintains the cache model information
     for the codestream, global summary information about the codestream,
     an interchange `kdu_codestream' object for dynamic construction of
     header and precinct data-bins, a second interchange codestream
     (`structure') for converting Window of Interest (WOI) coordinates into
     corresponding data-bins, and a reference (`source') to the
     `kdu_codestream' object managed by the ultimate `kdu_serve_target'.
     Not all of this information need be present, depending on the current
     state of existence.  Streams have the following states of existence:
     [>>] Collapsed -- in this state, summary information about the codestream
          has been recovered directly from `kdu_serve_target' without actually
          opening any codestream itself.  There is no cache model information,
          no `interchange' or `structure' codestream, and no association with
          any shared resources offered via the `kdu_serve_target' object.
          Collapsed codestreams cost very little to keep around, while
          preserving some basic information, which can be used to estimate
          the memory impact associated with a client request.  A collapsed
          codestream has a NULL `tiles' array.
     [>>] Expanded but Lightweight -- in this state, the `tiles' array is
          populated and capable of storing cache model information for the
          codestream.  However, none of the `kdu_codestream' interfaces is
          valid and there are no active representations of any of the
          codestream entities.  None of the `serve_target's resources
          are occupied in this mode.
     [>>] Expanded and Mediumweight -- in this state, the `tiles' array is
          populated and the `structure' and `interchange' codestreams are
          also available; these may occupy significant additional resources,
          depending on the internal representation of the interchange
          codestreams.  However, the `source' interface is empty, so there is
          no consumption of shared resources that are managed by the
          `serve_target'.
     [>>] Attached but Unlocked -- in this state, the `source' interface
          is non-empty, meaning that the object is attached to live
          `kdu_codestream' machinery which is managed by the `serve_target'.
          This may be expensive, so it's a good idea to avoid keeping too
          many attached codestreams.
     [>>] Locked -- in this state, the `source' interface is locked for
          exclusive access by the current working thread.  In this mode, the
          individual tiles can open their `kd_tile::source' interfaces and
          drag data into their interchange codestreams for the generation of
          data increments.
     [//]
     The `is_modeled' member is set to true when this stream is first accessed
     in a way which involves cache modeling of any form.  In practice, it
     is set only by `kd_codestream_window::sequence_active_bins' and reset
     only by `erase_cache_model'.
     [//]
     In addition to the above states of existence, a stream may be in the
     "active" state (corresponding to `num_active_contexts' > 0).  Throughout
     this documentation, the term "active" is reserved for objects for which
     data increments may be generated.  If a `kd_stream' is to be actively
     used, it will have to be attached to the `kdu_serve_target'.  However,
     it is possible to transition in and out of the active state without
     actually having any increments generated.  For this reason, a `kd_stream'
     which is in the active state must be expanded (i.e., must have a non-NULL
     `tiles' array) but need not immediately have a valid `source' interface.
     Conversely, a `kd_stream' which becomes inactive may remain attached
     for some time, so as to avoid deleting and renewing resources in the
     `serve_target' when the stream next needs to be actively used.
     [//]
     The reference counters are used to determine whether or not a `kd_stream'
     object may change its level of existence.  `num_window_refs' counts the
     number of `kd_codestream_window' objects which reference the stream.  If
     this value drops to zero, the stream may return to the collapsed state if
     desired.  `num_active_contexts' counts the number of `kd_window_context'
     objects which currently have the stream listed in their
     `active_streams' array.  If this count drops to zero, the stream may
     enter the Mediumweight or even Lightweight expanded state if desired,
     although it may be costly to re-attach the codestream to the
     `serve_target' -- so it should be detached only if resources are running
     low.  The `num_chunk_binrefs' member counts the number of `kd_binref'
     objects found in the `kds_chunk::bins' list managed by data chunks, which
     reference the stream.  The stream may not be totally destroyed unless all
     three counters reach zero.
     [//]
     `layer_log_slopes' is NULL if the codestream contains no information
     about the distortion-length slope thresholds which were used to create
     its quality layers.  Otherwise, this member points to an array with
     `num_layer_slopes' entries.  The value of `layer_log_slopes'[i] is
     equal to 256*(256-64+log_2(`slope')) where `slope' is the distortion
     length slope threshold associated with quality layer i.  Specifically,
     the slope threshold corresponds to the threshold applied to the
     ratio Delta_D / Delta_L, where Delta_D measures change in total
     squared error distortion for samples normalized to a nominal range of
     1.0, while Delta_L measures change in code-length in bytes.
     Note that the information in this array may be augmented with
     "dummy" slopes for hypothetical extra quality layers.  In particular,
     we generally need at least 1 more log slope value than
     `max_quality_layers'.  The values in this array are non-increasing
     and there are guaranteed to be at least `max_quality_layers'+1 of them.
     [//]
     The `active_layer_log_slopes' member either points to `layer_log_slopes'
     or to `kd_window_context::dummy_layer_log_slopes'.  In any event, it is
     configured to hold a non-NULL value by the function
     `kd_window_context::install_active_layer_log_slopes' which is invoked
     within `kd_window_context::simulate_increments'.  This allows the
     active slopes to potentially change each time the set of active streams
     changes -- important, because if some of the active streams have their
     own layer-log-slope information, while others do not, the complete set
     must use the `kd_window_context::dummy_layer_log_slopes' array for
     consistency.
     [//]
     The cache model state of the codestream's main header is managed by
     `dispatched_header_span', `dispatched_header_holes' and
     `header_span_complete'.  The `dispatched_header_span' member records
     the range of bytes for which information has been sent via generated
     data increments, while `dispatched_header_holes' points to a list of
     holes in this range of bytes, which may have arisen due to abandoned
     data chunks.  The `header_span_complete' member becomes non-zero if
     the `dispatched_header_span' includes the last byte of the codestream's
     main header data-bin and that fact has been communicated by inclusion
     of an end-of-databin flag within the relevant data increment message.

  /* Notes:
        This object serves three purposes: 1) it maintains basic structural
     information about the tile which is required for sequencing data-bin
     contributions; 2) it maintains potential interfaces to the original
     source of tile data (`source'), the interchange codestream which is
     used to prepare data, and the structure codestream which is used to
     convert window regions into associated data-bins -- any or all of
     these interfaces may be empty; and 3) it maintains cache
     model information for the tile -- this is done through the `comps'
     array and its own subordinate arrays.
        The `num_active_precincts' and `num_tile_binrefs' members maintain
     counts of the number of dynamic references which are currently held
     to this object.  The former counts the total number of
     `kd_active_precinct' objects which are modeling precincts associated
     with this tile, while the latter counts the number of `kd_active_binref'
     objects whose `tile' member points to this tile and which do not
     reference precincts.  If either of these counts is non-zero, the
     `interchange' interface should not be closed, because it is imminently
     needed or else managing potentially open `kdu_precinct' interfaces.
     On the other hand, when both these counters do go to zero
     (detected inside `kd_stream::release_active_binrefs'), the tile's
     `close' function will be called automatically, to clean up and
     recycle resources as soon as possible.
        The `is_modeled' and `next_modeled' members are used to build a
     list of all tiles in the containing `stream' which have potentially
     had cache model information associated with them.  This is of interest
     only for the stateless request processing mode, in which the cache
     model must be erased between requests.  In practice, we mark tiles as
     modeled when they are first accessed by
     `kd_window_context::sequence_active_bins' and we mark them as unmodeled
     inside `kd_stream::erase_cache_model'.  If `is_modeled' is non-zero,
     the `modeled_resolutions' member points to a list of all
     member `kd_resolution' objects for which any precinct cache models
     have been created.  The `kd_stream::erase_cache_model' erases all of
     these as well.
        The cache model state of the tile's header is managed by
     `dispatched_header_span', `dispatched_header_holes' and
     `header_span_complete'.  The `dispatched_header_span' member records
     the range of bytes for which information has been sent via generated
     data increments, while `dispatched_header_holes' points to a list of
     holes in this range of bytes, which may have arisen due to abandoned
     data chunks.  The `header_span_complete' member becomes non-zero if
     the `dispatched_header_span' includes the last byte of the tile
     header data-bin and that fact has been communicated by inclusion
     of an end-of-databin flag within the relevant data increment message.
        The `sim_header_span' and `sim_header_span_complete' members are used
     by `kd_context_window::simulate_increments', to keep track of simulation
     results prior to data increment generation.  After increment generation,
     `header_span_complete' is set to `sim_header_span_complete', while
     `dispatched_header_span' is increased to `sim_header_span' (if
     necessary) and any holes in the `dispatched_header_holes' list are
     truncated or removed if they intersect with the range of bytes
     identified by `sim_header_span'.

  /* Notes:
        This structure plays a central role in managing the active state of
     the server.  Whereas a `kd_precinct_model' structure might be maintained
     for every precinct in the image (although we would hope to have a lot
     of empty precinct blocks if the image is very large) the current
     structure is used only for precincts which are considered "active".
     Active precincts are those which are currently available for processing
     by `kd_context_window::generate_increments'.
        In general, each window context contributes its own set of active
     precincts, some of which may be in common with other window contexts.
     Given this commonality, a single doubly-linked list of all active
     precincts is maintained by the `kd_serve' object, and pointers into
     this list are maintained by individual lists of `kd_binref' objects
     which are private to each window context.  The `num_active_binrefs' member
     keeps track of the number of window contexts from which a single
     `kd_active_precinct' object is referenced.  When this value drops to
     0, the entry is removed from the shared doubly-linked list of active
     precincts.
        The cache model for each data-bin involves the notion of a
     `dispatched_span' and `dispatched_holes'.  The dispatched span is the
     range of bytes (starting from 0) for which data has been generated via
     `kdu_serve::generate_increments'.  The `dispatched_holes' is a list
     of holes in this range of bytes -- holes arise as a result of abandoned
     data chunks (typically as a result of a lossy communication medium with
     a client).  The `span_complete' member becomes non-zero if the
     `dispatched_span' includes all bytes in the precinct data-bin.  This
     condition means that the special end-of-databin flag has been included
     in a data chunk dispatched via `kdu_serve::generate_increments'.  Even if
     the `dispatched_span' includes all bytes of the precinct data-bin, the
     `span_complete' member does not become non-zero until the end-of-databin
     flag has been sent.
        The `num_packets' and `num_packet_bytes' members describe the initial
     set of contiguous packets for the precinct whose contents lie within
     the `dispatched_span' and occur prior to any `dispatched_holes'.  The
     `num_packet_bytes' member keeps track of the number of bytes associated
     with the first `num_packets' packets of the precinct, which means that
     `num_packet_bytes' <= `dispatched_span' and, if `dispatched_holes' is
     non-NULL, `num_packet_bytes' <= `dispatched_holes->start'.
        If `num_packet_bytes' is negative, the object has only just been
     initialized from the long-term cache model state contained within a
     `kd_precinct_model' object.  The `kd_window_context::load_active_precinct'
     function must then be used to figure out what values should be taken
     by `dispatched_span', `num_packets' and `num_packet_bytes'. In this
     state, if `dispatched_span' is -ve, the state of the cache model is
     deduced from `num_packets' and any model holes which intersect the
     range of bytes associated with `num_packets' are removed within
     `kd_window_context::load_active_precinct'.  Otherwise, the smaller of
     `dispatched_span' and `dispatched_holes->start' (if it exists) is used
     to deduce the value of `num_packets'.
        `sim_span', `sim_packets', `sim_packet_bytes' and `sim_span_complete'
     are used by `kd_context_window::simulate_increments' to record simulation
     information which becomes permanent when the data-bin increments are
     actually dispatched.  However, the interpretation of these members
     involves some subtle differences from their non-simulation counterparts.
     The `sim_span' value holds the length of the smallest initial span
     of bytes from the precinct data-bin which contains all bytes that are to
     be dispatched during the generation of increments.  What this means
     is that any `dispatched_holes' will be truncated or removed if they
     lie within this range; moreover, `dispatched_span' will become the
     greater of `dispatched_span' and `sim_span' once increments have been
     generated.
        The `sim_packets' member counts whole packets which have been
     simulated, while `sim_packet_bytes' counts the number of bytes
     associated with `sim_packets' whole packets.  Although `sim_span' is
     usually at least as large as `sim_packet_bytes', it can happen that
     `sim_packets' and `sim_packet_bytes' are advanced during the simulation
     process, without actually advancing `sim_bytes' -- this happens if the
     size of the resulting increment would be too small to be worthwhile.
     The simulation process involves progressively incrementing
     `sim_packets' until it eventually reaches `max_packets'.  The
     `num_packets' and `num_packet_bytes' values become equal to
     `sim_packets' and `sim_packet_bytes' only if increments are actually
     dispatched.
        The `max_id_length' member is used to remember the calculated maximum
     length of the data-bin ID field in any message header used to communicate
     data for this precinct.  It only needs to be calculated when an
     active precinct is first considered for inclusion by
     `kd_window_context::generate_increments'.
        The `hdr_threshold' member is used in simulating the maximum number
     of message header bytes associated with data for this precinct.  The
     value records the maximum value that `current_bytes' can take on before
     a new message header might have to be generated.  It is initialized to
     -1 inside `kd_window_context::simulate_packet_generation' before each
     simulation attempt.  The purpose of this member is to limit the frequency
     with which message header length simulation must be performed.

  /* Notes:
        This class is the fundamental element in the cache model managed

     variable of the form 2*C + 4*V + (Hs<<32) + (Ls<<48), or else 1 plus
     the 4/8-byte aligned address of a `kd_active_precinct' object.  The
     values, C, V, Hs and Ls have the following interpretations:
     [>>] C is a 1-bit flag, whose interpretation is identical to that of
          `kd_active_precinct::span_complete'.
     [>>] V is a 30-bit signed 2's complement integer, whose interpretation
          is identical to that of `kd_active_precinct::dispatched_span'.  Note
          that if V is -ve, -V is to be interpreted as the number of packets,
          rather than the number of bytes spanned by the cache model; this
          only happens if the cache model is adjusted in response to
          packet-oriented cache model manipulation statements from the client.
          Once a precinct has entered the active state and the
          `kd_window_context::load_active_precinct' function has been called,
          packet counts are converted into equivalent byte spans.
     [>>] Hs and Ls may be used to record information about an internal hole
          in the span identified by V.  This means that a multi-hole
          `kd_active_precinct::dispatched_holes' list may need to be
          approximated by a single larger hole when the precinct's cache
          model is collapsed down to a single 64-bit `state' value.  If
          there is no hole, Hs and Ls should both be 0.  Otherwise, the
          hole starts at byte position Hs and extends up to, but not
          including byte position Ls.

  /* Notes:
          The fundamental cache element is that of a precinct.  However, there
       can be an enormous number of precincts in an image (well over a
       million) if it is truly huge.  Moreover, the majority of these might
       all be in a single resolution of a single tile-component.  Since
       relatively few of these will ever be touched by a client, memory
       can be conserved by providing a block-based structure for accessing
       the precinct cache elements.  This structure is described and
       managed by the last few member variables of the present object, starting
       from the `pblock_size' member.
          The `pblock_size' member indicates the nominal width and the height
       of each precinct cache block.  Thus, each cache block manages an
       array of `pblock_size' x `pblock_size' precincts.
          The `log_pblock_size' member holds log_2(`pblock_size'), where
       `pblock_size' is guaranteed to be an exact power of 2.
          `num_pblocks' indicates the number of precinct cache blocks in
       each direction.
          `pblocks' holds one pointer for each cache block.  The pointers are
       organized in raster fashion, with `num_pblocks.x' pointers on each
       row.  Each element of the array holds either NULL or a pointer to
       a `kd_precinct_block' object, whose entries are themselves organized
       in raster scan fashion, measuring `num_pblocks' by `num_pblocks'.
          `active_pblocks' manages a list of precinct blocks which are
       currently referenced from within the `pblocks' array.  If non-NULL,
       this member points to the location within `pblocks' at which the
       reference to the first active precinct block on the list may be found.
       The list is connected indirectly via `kd_precinct_block::active_next',
       which is NULL at the end of the list, or else points to the location
       in `pblocks' which references the next active precinct block.  This
       indirect list referencing structure allows the `pblock' references to
       be reset to NULL as the list is being cleaned up.
          `next_modeled' is used to build a list of all `kd_resolution'
       objects within a `kd_tile' for which `is_modeled' is true.  These
       are the objects which can have a non-NULL `active_pblocks' member.

         make it legal, installs a new set of codestream windows in the

         false; the transition to the `new_stream_windows' is not actually
         completed until the next call to `sequence_active_bins', which
         detects the `update_window_streams' flag left behind by this
         function.
            If `window_imagery_changed' is false, the new window of interest

         model instructions or changes in the request processing preferences,

         codestreams which can be simultaneously active.  For these reasons,
         this function may need to be called multiple times.

         If `update_window_streams' is true on entry, the function is
         being called for the first time after a change in the requested
         window of interest for this context.  In this case, the function
         initializes the sweeping machinery, taking special care to preserve
         common elements between the current and previous request windows.
         [//]
         If `update_window_metadata' is true on entry, the function is
         being called for the first time after a change in the metadata
         aspects of the requested window of interest, but without any change
         in the imagery aspects.  In this case, the function leaves the
         sweep machinery and all active codestream data-bins intact, but
         regenerates the active metadata-bins.
         [//]
         Otherwise, the function is being called to advance the set of
         active data-bins.  In this process, the function cycles through the
         set of all codestream windows progressively.  Each time it passes
         the first codestream window, the function decreases the number of
         extra discard levels (if non-zero) or else increases the
         `active_bin_rate_threshold'.

         but there is still the possibility that abandoned data-chunks will
         cause one or both of these members to become non-NULL so that
         future sequencing calls can add active data-bins.

         loose and tight bounds, respectively, on the total number of message
         bytes (including headers) that should be associated with the
         simulated increments.  In practice, this function can only use a
         conservative upper bound on the number of header bytes.  A bound on
         the length of a single message header is obtained using the
         `serve' object's `id_encoder', together with the
         `using_extended_message_headers' argument.  The function recognizes
         that multiple messages may be required, but it assumes that
         at least `suggested_chunk_body_bytes'/4 message body bytes
         will be transferred in the first message of any byte range which is
         split across multiple chunks. The caller must be careful to follow
         this principle so as to avoid accidentally violating the
         `max_total_bytes' limit when data is delivered.
           The `min_msg_increment' argument specifies a minimum value for
         the number of body bytes to send in any JPIP message, unless that
         message happens to be critical to completing the data-bin or a
         required packet alignment threshold.
           The function returns the simulated number of message bytes.  In the
         event that simulation stopped as a result of reaching the hard limit
         associated with the `max_total_bytes' argument, the function returns

         `dispatched_span' and `dispatched_holes' members can be relied upon
         to determine the state of the cache model for the precinct in
         question.
            If required, the function opens the relevant interface and loads

         must be included in outgoing data chunks.  If `hdr_threshold' is -ve,
         the function calculates the header cost directly and sets
         `hdr_threshold' equal to the maximum value of `range_lim' for which
         the estimated header cost is valid.  If `hdr_threshold' is
         non-negative on entry, the function calculates the number of new
         message header bytes required and updates `hdr_threshold'.
         The `extended_num_packets' argument is 0 if extended message headers
         are not required; otherwise, it is the number of packets which must
         be signalled via an extended precinct data-bin message header.
           The algorithm implemented here assumes that the threshold for
         possibly splitting a byte range into multiple messages is
         B/4 message body bytes, where B = `suggested_chunk_body_bytes'-- as
         explained in connection with the `simulate_increments' function.
         Thus, the first `hdr_threshold' value will be `range_start' + B/4.
         Each successive `hdr_threshold' value is B-L bytes greater, where L
         is the calculated worst case message header size, allowing for
         chunk boundaries which fall anywhere from the previous
         `hdr_threshold' to the new `hdr_threshold'-1. The splitting threshold
         applies to range bytes, not range bytes + header bytes.  This
         splitting policy must be followed `generate_xxx_increments'

  /* Notes:
        A window context corresponds to a single JPIP request channel.  Each
     window context manages its own window of interest, for which data is
     generated in epochs.  The window of interest is expressed, in turn, via
     `kd_codestream_window' objects, each of which represents a single
     rectangular window into a particular set of image components
     of a single codestream at a particular resolution.  We refer to these as
     "codestream windows" (or "stream windows", for short).
        The term "active" refers to the collection of codestream elements
     which are actively available to the `generate_increments' function.
        Each window context has two limits which are used to restrict the
     amount of codestream resources it can consume at any given time.  The
     first limit is the number of codestreams that we are prepared
     to consider in a given window request from the client.  This limit is
     given by `KD_MAX_WINDOW_CODESTREAMS'.  The second limit is the number
     of codestreams which can be simultaneously active -- the active
     codestreams must be simultaneously attached and locked during calls
     to the `generate_increments' function, so they can be costly to keep
     around; this limit is given by `KD_MAX_ACTIVE_CODESTREAMS'.
        The `stream_windows' member points to a list of all codestream windows
     that are associated with the window of interest that the context is
     currently managing.  There are guaranteed to be at most
     `KD_MAX_WINDOW_CODESTREAMS' distinct `kd_stream' objects referenced
     from this list.  The `new_stream_windows' and `old_stream_windows'
     members are used to manage the transition between an old window of
     interest and a new one.  During this transition, the complete set of
     codestream windows which represents the new window of interest is first
     collected in the `new_stream_windows' list.  The next call to
     `sequence_active_bins' then moves these new stream windows into the
     current stream windows list, releasing the old ones.  As an
     intermediate step, `sequence_active_bins' temporarily stores the list of
     old stream windows using the `old_stream_windows' member, so that it can
     be released properly in the event that an exception occurs during the
     call to `sequence_active_bins'.
        `first_active_stream_window' points to the first codestream window
     within the `stream_windows' list which is currently active, meaning that
     it is contributing active data-bins for the generation of increments.
     Similarly, `last_active_stream_window' points to the last active stream
     window.  Scanning the list from `first_active_stream_window' until
     `last_active_stream_window' (with wrap-around at the end of the list)
     will visit all active stream windows.  Out of these, however, there
     may be some which are not actually contributing any active data-bins
     and so do not contribute to the `KD_MAX_ACTIVE_CODESTREAMS' quota on
     active `kd_stream' objects.
        The above-mentioned quota on active `kd_stream' objects is managed by
     the `num_active_streams', `active_streams' and `num_active_stream_refs'
     members, via the `remove_active_stream_ref' and `add_active_stream_ref'
     functions.  Specifically, the `active_streams' array keeps track of
     `num_active_streams' pointers to `kd_stream' objects which are
     actively in use by this window context, while the `num_active_stream_refs'
     array keeps track of the number of `kd_codestream_window' objects which
     are using these active streams.  Each `kd_codestream_window' object
     which is contributing active data-bin references contributes to the
     count associated with the relevant active `kd_stream' entry here.
        The `stream_indices', `first_stream_windows' and `last_stream_windows'
     arrays are managed by the `process_window_changes' function -- via calls
     to `add_stream' and `insert_new_stream_window'.  New window requests are
     converted into a sequence of codestream windows, which are initially
     stored at `new_stream_windows' (until the call to `sequence_active_bins').
     To ensure that there are at most `KD_MAX_WINDOW_CODESTREAMS' distinct
     codestreams associated with these stream windows, and to keep the stream
     windows organized in increasing order of their associated codestream
     indices, we store the distinct codestream indices used within the
     `stream_indices' array, while using the `first_stream_windows' and
     `last_stream_windows' arrays to store pointers to the first and last
     codestream windows with each codestream index, as they appear within the
     `stream_windows' list.  The number of used entries in these arrays is
     given by `num_streams', which grows each time a distinct codestream
     is encountered.  Note that if `new_stream_windows' is non-NULL, the
     `stream_indices', `first_stream_windows' and `last_stream_windows'
     members actually refer to the new collection of codesteam windows,
     rather than the existing one managed by the `stream_windows' list -- this
     is a transient condition created by the processing of window of interest
     changes without any intervening generation of increments.
        The `sweep_start' and `sweep_next' members maintain the state of
     the sequencing machine.  Specifically, `sweep_next' points to the next
     `kd_codestream_window' from which active data-bins can
     potentially be sequenced by calling its `sequence_active_bins' function.
     The sweep machinery starts at `sweep_start', which is usually the same
     as `stream_windows', but may be different if the window-of-interest
     was changed to one which overlapped with a previous one and we found it
     beneficial to start the sweep machinery for the new window of interest
     at the place we were previously up to.
        The `meta_sweep_next' member plays a similar role to `sweep_next',
     except that it is used for sequencing active metadata-bin references.
     In the current implementation, this member is either equal to
     `stream_windows' or else NULL, since any call to `sequence_active_bins'
     which finds `meta_sweep_next' non-NULL automatically generates a complete
     set of metadata-bin references for the request, taking all codestream
     windows into account simultaneously.  Better incremental handling of
     metadata for requests with a large number of codestream windows is left
     as something for the future.  For the moment, we take the stated approach
     because it prevents us from having to make many redundant passes through
     the metadata tree.
        Once `sweep_next' and `meta_sweep_next' both become NULL, no further
     sequencing of active data-bins is required and indeed the next call to
     `sequence_active_bins' will leave the `active_bins' list entirely empty.
     However, one or both of these conditions may be reversed by the handling
     of abandoned data chunks.
        `last_translated_window' holds a copy of the window, as passed into
     `kdu_serve::set_window', which was last translated via
     `process_window_changes'.  If `window_changed' is false, this window
     differs from `current_window' only in regard to changes which have
     been made by the server, either in translating codestream contexts,
     or in restricting the region of interest so as to conserve resources.
     If `window_changed' is true, the `last_translated_window' and
     `current_window' members may be used to identify any changes between
     the previous and current requests.
        The `active_bins' member points to a linked list of active data-bin
     references, in which all metadata-bins appear at the start, followed
     by references to stream-header, tile-header and precinct data-bins.  The
     last metadata-bin reference is identified by `last_active_metabin', which
     allows the codestream data-bin references to cleanly separated from the
     metadata-bin references.
        The `old_active_bins' member is used by `sequence_active_bins' to store
     a temporary list of previous active codestream data-bin references, which
     we don't want to release until after new active data-bin references have
     been fully generated (so we don't have to reconstruct active precinct
     resources which are in common between successive sets of active
     data-bins).  By storing the old list here, we ensure that it can be
     properly released in the event that an exception is caught during the
     sequencing of new active data-bins.  The same reasoning lies behind the
     `new_active_bins' list which stores new active codestream data-bin
     references which we cannot add to `active_bins' until they have all
     been generated, but we don't want the list to be lost in the event that
     an exception is thrown.
        `active_bin_ptr' holds a pointer to the next element of the
     `active_bins' list which is to be considered by the
     `simulate_packet_generation' function.
        `active_threshold' holds the threshold which is currently being used by
     `simulate_packet_generation' to determine the next packet contribution
     to be included in the batch of increments being prepared by
     `generate_increments'.  At each element in the active precinct
     list, `active_threshold' is compared against `layer_log_slopes'[i] +
     delta where `i' is the value of the element's `next_layer' member,
     delta is the value of the element's `log_relevance' member, and
     `layer_log_slopes' is the `kd_codestream_window::layer_log_slopes' array
     for the element's code-stream.  If `active_threshold' is less than or
     equal to this value, the number of packets for that precinct is
     considered for augmentation.
        `next_active_threshold' is the value which should be assigned to
     `active_threshold' once `active_ptr' reaches the end of the `active_bins'.
     It is computed incrementally, while the active list is being processed,
     in such a way as to minimize the number of processing passes, while
     maintaining the desired ordering properties.  Specifically, while scanning
     through the list of active precincts, the value of `next_active_threshold'
     is set to the smallest value which ensures that no more than 1 layer
     will be included from any precinct during the next scan.
       `scan_first_layer' is set to true whenever the `active_bins' list
     is changed.  When this member is true, the next scan through the active
     bin list inside `simulate_increments' will ignore the `active_threshold'
     value and consider the first layer of every precinct as a candidate for
     inclusion in the increments being prepared by `generate_increments',
     unless that layer has already been included.  The reason for treating
     the first layer differently is that its log-slope-threshold value is
     not a reliable indication of the actual distortion-length slopes of the
     underlying code-block coding passes; the slopes may have been arbitrarily
     steeper than this threshold.  As a result, the R-D optimal layer
     resequencing algorithm may fail to allocate sufficient weight to
     lower resolution precincts, which often have reduced log-relevance
     due to the fact that their region of influence is larger than the
     window region.  After the first scan through the active precinct list,
     `scan_first_layer' reverts to false, but it may be set to true again
     if the cache model for one of the active precincts is downgraded.
        `scanned_precinct_bytes' is set to 0 at the start of each scan
     through the active bin list inside `simulate_increments', and then
     used to add up the `kd_active_precinct::sim_span' values associated
     with all encountered precinct data-bin references.  Similarly,
     `scanned_precinct_samples' is used to accumulate the total number of
     precinct samples for which code bytes are accumulated by
     `scanned_precinct_bytes'.  This allows the `simulate_increments'
     function to determine whether sufficient data is available for a
     partial collection of active streams and precincts to move on to a new
     set.
        `scanned_incomplete_metabins' and `scanned_incomplete_codestream_bins'
     are used to count the number of outstanding meta data-bins and
     codestream-related data-bins on the `active_bins' list, for which
     data still needs to be dispatched.  As with the other `scanned_...'
     members, these counters are set to 0 when `active_ptr'=`active_bins'
     and their values are checked at the end of a complete scan through the
     set of active data-bins.

        The interpretation of the above member variables generally requires

     to the set of tiles (resp. precincts) which are relevant to the
     associated `kd_codestream_window'.
        The `cn' member is an index into an array of codestream image
     components which cannot be formed without accessing the relevant tile
     in the interchange codestream managed by an expanded `kd_stream' object;
     it depends on the coding parameters associated with the tile, together
     with the image components of interest to the `kd_codestream_window'
     whose data-bins are to be sequenced.  Nevertheless, the counter starts
     out at 0 and advances from there, as with `r_idx'. */

         `window_max_layers, `window_region', `window_tiles',
         `component_ranges' and `context_component_indices' members.
         Note that a non-positive value for `max_required_layers' is
         interpreted as no limit at all.
         [//]
         The function may also be called from within
         `kd_window_context::process_window_changes' to adjust some of the
         above parameters.  This case is easily distinguished from the first
         by the fact that the `stream' and `context' members are already
         set correctly, as opposed to holding NULL.  Making the distinction
         is important because in the first case, the function automatically
         adds the codestream window to the `stream->windows' list.
         [//]
         Note that this function does not require the `stream' object to be
         in the "attached" or even "expanded" state; no attempt will be made
         to access tiles or their parameters.  As a result, the codestream
         window can be initialized without having to actually occupy shared
         resources in the `kdu_serve_target' object.
         [//]
         The `component_ranges' argument identifies the set of
         codestream components which might belong to the window.  If this is
         an empty set, the internal `component_ranges' member is
         initialized to represent all codestream image components.  If
         `num_context_components' <= 0, there are no further restrictions
         on the set of relevant codestream components.  Otherwise,
         `context_component_indices' must point to an array with
         `num_context_components' entries, which identify the set of
         output image components which are of interest -- these have
         been derived from a codestream context.  For a discussion of
         the differences between output and codestream image components,
         see the `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' function.
         For our present purposes here, it is sufficient to realize that
         each output component may be formed from multiple codestream
         components and that the mapping between output components and
         codestream components may vary from tile-to-tile.

         This estimate is based purely on information generated by
         `initialize' and does not require the associated `kd_stream' object
         to be "attached" or even "expanded".  In particular, we cannot
         explicitly determine the properties of multi-component transforms,
         which can be tile-dependent, so we cannot reliably infer the number
         of codestream image components required to form output image
         components.
         [//]
         The function allows a `kd_window_context' object to determine a
         (possibly) reduced resolution at which all of its codestream windows

         the memory constraint associated with the `KD_MAX_WINDOW_SAMPLES'

      /* This function implements the central algorithm used to sequence
         codestream-related data-bins onto the `active_bins' list maintained
         by a window context (see `kd_window_context').  It is important that
         even very large windows of interest, or windows of interest which
         span a massive number of codestreams, can be served in a manner
         which does not consume too much memory.  To do this,
         `kd_window_context::sequence_active_bins' issues calls to its
         `kd_codestream_window' objects' `sequence_active_bins' function in
         a sequence of stages, which may involve multiple sweeps through the
         content.  During any given sweep, a reduced resolution version of the
         codestream window may be used (as indicated by `extra_discard_levels')
         so that a remote client can obtain a reduced resolution representation
         quickly, in the event that the server cannot deliver everything
         together in truly quality-progressive fashion.
         [//]
         If the internal `sequencing_active' flag is false, sequencing of
         active data-bins starts from scratch; otherwise, it starts from
         where sequencing last left off.  The present function leaves
         the `sequencing_active' flag equal to true if and only if the
         process of sequencing data-bins has been started, but not yet
         completed for the current codestream window.
         [//]
         On entry, `head' point to the start of the relevant
         `kd_context_window' object's `active_bins' list, while the
         `res_tails' array contains a collection of pointers into this list,
         each of which identifies the last active binref for a given resolution
         level.  Specifically, `res_tails' is expected to hold 33 entries
         (no more and no less), all of which are initialized to NULL when
         `head' is NULL.  These entries are used to sort the elements in the
         generated `active_bins' list according to their resolution, in a
         manner which does not incur much processing overhead.  The contents
         of this array are temporary, but each non-NULL pointer must point into
         the single linked list headed by `head'.
         [//]
         The function updates `head' and the `res_tails' entries as active
         data-bins are added, returning true if anything was added to the
         list headed by `head'.  A false return means that:
              All remaining data-bins associated with this codestream window
              (starting from any pre-existing sequencing state, and accounting
              for the `extra_discard_levels' value) have already
              been fully dispatched, at least to the limit identified by
              `window_max_layers'.
         [//]
         If the function does return true, the object's `is_active' flag is
         set to true.  However, the function does not ever reset this flag.
         The `kd_window_context::sequence_active_bins' function resets
         the `is_active' flags of all previously active codestream windows
         before sequencing a fresh set of active data-bins, but the present
         function could be used differently, in which case it might necessarily
         be correct to reset the flag prior to each call to this function.
         This is why the function does not reset the flag itself.
         [//]
         The `max_samples' argument is used to limit the number of precinct
         data-bins which are sequenced before this function returns.  If
         this value is <= 0, no limit is applied.  Otherwise, the limit
         becomes exhausted when the number of samples associated with
         precint databins exceeds `max_samples'.
         [//]
         Note that when this function is called, the `stream' object is
         guaranteed to be in the "active" state.  This does not necessarily
         mean that it has been "attached" or that a cache model even exists
         yet, but it does mean that these things are allowed to happen as
         the need arises -- the number of active codestreams is limited in
         such a way that resources should exist to support the attaching and
         locking of all active codestreams simultaneously if required.
         [//]
         If `model_instructions' is non-NULL, the function processes any
         cache model instructions which apply to the content being sequenced.
         As explained with `kdu_window_model', this causes the processed
         atomic cache model instructions to be removed so that they will not
         accidentally be processed multiple times when `sequence_active_bins'
         is invoked again.  We do, however, need to be careful to process
         non-atomic cache model instructions multiple times since these
         cannot be removed from the `model_instructions' object in a reliable
         way.  Fortunately (this is by design), non-atomic cache model
         instructions are permitted only in the stateless mode and we can
         tell whether or not we are visiting a data-bin for the first time
         in stateless mode, because the entire cache model is guaranteed to
         be empty before we start processing a stateless request.

  /* Notes:
        Each codestream window contributes some set of codestream elements
     (precinct data-bins and header data-bins) to its containing window
     context (as given by the `context' member).  To provide for requests
     which cover very large windows of interest, or very many codestreams, we
     cannot generally load all such data-bins into memory at once and run the
     layer progressive (or virtual layer progressive) scheduling algorithm
     over them.  Instead, we must be prepared to schedule codestream elements
     into the active data-bin set managed by `kd_window_context' progressively
     and then generate increments in layer progressive fashion from just these
     active data-bins.  There are thus two additional elements in the machinery
     beyond layer progressive generation of data-bin increments which must be
     realized: 1) machinery to sequence data-bins into the active working set;
     and 2) machinery to determine how much data should be generated for the
     active set before we advance the sequencing machinery.  None of this is
     all that simple, but very important for managing memory consumption and
     data access costs in the server.
        The `sequencing_active' member indicates whether or not the
     sequencing machinery has been started and has not yet finished passing
     through all relevant data-bins in calls to `generate_active_bins'.
        The `content_incomplete' flag plays an important role in avoiding
     unnecessary accesses to codestream content.  When the sequencing state
     machinery is started from scratch, this flag is reset to false, unless
     `sequence_active_bins' is invoked with a non-zero `extra_discard_levels'
     argument, in which case it is set to true.  Once active data-bins have
     been processed, if it turns out that their contents were not completely
     dispatched by `kd_window_context::generate_increments', the codestream
     windows from which they came have their `content_incomplete' flags set
     to true.  If the active data-bin sequencing machinery moves past a
     particular codestream window and its `content_complete' flag is still
     set to zero, the `fully_dispatched' flag can be set to true.

  /* Notes:
       Resource consumption in the `kdu_serve_target' object and in the
     management of cache models, depends on the state in which `kd_stream'
     objects are maintained.  As noted in connection with that object, a
     `kd_stream' can be "collapsed", "expanded but not attached",
     "attached but not locked", and "locked".  A stream can also be active,
     meaning that the need for it to be attached (and later locked) is
     anticipated, but the stream need not be attached until the need actually
     arises.
       The `stream_refs' array maintains one entry for each possible codestream
     in the `target' object.  In the future, it may be necessary to provide
     an hierarchical structure to manage a massive number of codestreams, but
     as it is one could expect to handle hours of video with one codestream
     per frame.  Many entries in the `stream_refs' array may be NULL, so we
     also reference the non-NULL entries through various lists, as described
     below.
       `collapsed_unused_streams' is a list of the `kd_stream' objects which
     are collapsed (i.e., having no `tiles' array).  These are necessarily
     not referenced from within any `kd_codestream_window' and not attached to
     the serve `target'.
       `lightweight_unused_streams' is a list of the `kd_stream' objects which
     are expanded, yet do not yet have any codestream interfaces
     (`interchange', `structure' or `source').  These are necessarily not
     referenced from within any `kd_codestream_window' or attached to the
     serve `target', yet they are able to retain cache model information.
       `mediumweight_unused_streams' is a list of the `kd_stream' objects
     which are expanded and have `interchange' and `structure' codestream
     interfaces, yet are not referenced from any `kd_codestream_window' and are
     not attached to the serve `target'.
       `attached_unused_streams' is a list of the `kd_stream' objects which
     are expanded and have a full set of `source', `interchange' and
     `structure' codestream interfaces, being attached to the serve `target',
     while not currently being referenced by any `kd_codestream_window'.
       `inactive_streams' is a list of all `kd_stream' objects which are
     currently referenced from within at least one `kd_codestream_window',
     but are not yet active.  These are necessarily expanded, but they might
     not yet have any codestream interfaces.
       `active_streams' is a list of all `kd_stream' objects which are
     currently active.  These are necessarily referenced from at least one
     `kd_codestream_window' and have at least `interchange' and `structure'
     codestream interfaces.  They will generally need to be attached to
     the serve `target' if this has not been done already.
        The `num_attached_streams' and `num_expanded_streams' members keep
     track of the total number of codestreams which are attached to the
     `kdu_serve_target' object and the total number of codestreams which
     have non-NULL `tiles' arrays, respectively.  Each of these members
     counts codestreams which may appear on more than one of the above
     lists.  The `num_collapsed_streams' counts only those
     codestreams which are collapsed (these should all be on the
     `collapsed_unused_streams' list).  Together,
     `num_collapsed_steams' and `num_expanded_streams' account for all
     `kd_stream' objects which are currently in existence.
        The object operates only in stateless or stateful mode.  The
     `is_stateless' argument found in the first call to `kdu_serve::set_window'
     determines which mode is being used and it is illegal to mix request
     types.  In the stateless mode, the `stateless_image_done' flag is used
     to record whether or not the entire target's contents have been
     dispatched by `generate_increments' in response to the most recent
     window of interest request.  This flag is reset whenever a new window
     of interest arrives, and set to true if `num_completed_codestreams' is
     found to be equal to `total_codestreams' and `num_completed_metabins'
     is found to be equal to `total_metabins' at the point when
     `kd_window_context::generate_increments' finishes generating all
     content for its window of interest.
