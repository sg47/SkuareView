Description:
   Simple example showing compression with an intermediate buffer used to
store the image samples.  This is, of course, a great waste of memory and
the more sophisticated "kdu_compress" and "kdu_buffered_compress" applications
do no such thing.  However, developers may find this type of introductory
example helpful as a first exercise in understanding how to use Kakadu.  The
vast majority of Kakadu's interesting features are not utilized by this
example, but it may be enough to satisfy the initial needs of some developers
who are working with moderately large images, already in an internal buffer.
For a more sophisticated compression application, which is still quite
readily comprehended, see the "kdu_buffered_compress" application.
   The emphasis here is on showing a minimal number of instructions required
to open a codestream object, create a processing engine and push an image into
the engine, producing a given number of automatically selected rate-distortion
optimized quality layers for a quality-progressive representation.
   You may find it interesting to open the compressed codestream using
the "kdu_show" utility, examine the properties (file:properties menu item),
and investigate the quality progression associated with the default set of
quality layers created here (use the "<" and ">" keys to navigate through
the quality layers interactively).

     // additional information concerning the colour and geometric properties
     // of the image, all of which should be respected by conforming readers.
     // To do this, include "jp2.h" and declare "output" to be of class
     // `jp2_target' instead of `kdu_simple_file_target'.  Rather than opening
     // the `jp2_target' object directly, you first creat a `jp2_family_tgt'
     // object, using it to open the file to which you want to write, and then
     // pass it to `jp2_target::open'.  At a minimum, you must execute the
     // following additional configuration steps to create a JP2 file:
     //     jp2_dimensions dims = output.access_dimensions(); dims.init(&siz);
     //     jp2_colour colr = output.access_colour();

     // sophisticated demonstration in "kdu_compress.cpp".  A simple
     // demonstration appears also in "kdu_buffered_compress.cpp".
     //    A common question is how you can get the compressed data written
     // out to a memory buffer, instead of a file.  To do this, simply
     // derive a memory buffering object from the abstract base class,
     // `kdu_compressed_target' and pass this into `kdu_codestream::create'.
     // If you want a memory resident JP2 file, pass your memory-buffered
     // `kdu_compressed_target' object to the second form of the overloaded
     // `jp2_family_tgt::open' function and proceed as before.

  codestream.access_siz()->parse_string("Clayers=12");
  codestream.access_siz()->parse_string("Creversible=yes");
  codestream.access_siz()->finalize_all(); // Set up coding defaults

  // Now compress the image in one hit, using `kdu_stripe_compressor'

  compressor.finish();
    // As an alternative to the above, you can read the image samples in
    // smaller stripes, calling `compressor.push_stripe' after each stripe.
    // Note that the `kdu_stripe_compressor' object can be used to realize
    // a wide range of Kakadu compression features, while supporting a wide
    // range of different application-selected stripe buffer configurations
    // precisions and bit-depths.  When developing your Kakadu-based
    // compression application, be sure to read through the extensive
    // documentation provided for this object.  For a much richer demonstration
    // of the use of `kdu_stripe_compressor', take a look at the
    // "kdu_buffered_compress" application.
