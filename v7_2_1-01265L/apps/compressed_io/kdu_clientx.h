Description:
  Defines a JPX-specific version of the `kdu_client_translator' interface,
for translating JPX codestream context requests into individual codestream
window requests for the purpose of determining what image elements already
exist in the client's cache.

     [SYNOPSIS]
       Provides an implementation of the `kdu_client_translator' interface
       for the specific case of JP2/JPX files.  It is not strictly necessary
       to provide any translator for JP2 files, but since JP2 is a subset
       of JPX, there is no problem providing the implementation here.  All
       the translation work is done inside the `update' member.  If it finds
       the data source not to be JPX-compatible, all translation calls
       will fail, producing null/false results, as appropriate.
