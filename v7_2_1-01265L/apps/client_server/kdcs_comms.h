       It might be useful to call this at the start of an application which

       matching call to `kdcs_cleanup_network'.  In practice, these calls do
       nothing except in a Windows-based OS.  Even then, there is no need
       to explicitly call the function yourself.  Whenever you use any
       of the API functions defined in this header file which calls for
       network services, the `kdcs_start_network' function will be called
       for you automatically -- there is no harm in calling it multiple
       times -- to start up networking services if they are not already
       available.
       [//]
       You may find it useful to invoke `kdcs_cleanup_network' yourself if
       there is a point in an application when networking services are not
       required for some time and you wish to reclaim the resources.
       However, in practice, it is unlikely that you will feel the need to
       call these functions explicitly yourself.
       [//]
       If something goes wrong with an application which depends upon
       networking, it may be useful to explicitly call this function and
       check the return value. If false, you know that the networking
       services failed to start.  This might happen, for example, if too
       many tasks are currently interacting with networking resources on
       the current platform.

           avoid unnecessary allocation and reallocation of buffers.

           the object was constructed.
           [//]
           On some platforms, the resolution of the clock used here might
           be on the order of several milliseconds.  On other platforms,
           the clock resolution might be on the order of microseconds or
           might even run at the same rate as the CPU clock.  In any case,
           this object provides the means for reliably accumulating times
           at very high precision, when available, without having to worry
           about the internal mechanics.
           [//]
           On some platforms, it is possible that the function will not work
           correctly if it is invoked too infrequently (e.g., only invoked
           once a month or something like that).  In practice, though, this
           should not be an issue for reasonable client/server applications.
           [//]
           Depending on the precision of the internal clock, it is possible
           that successive calls to this function return the same value;
           however, no call to this function will ever return a value smaller
           than a previous call, even if the internal clock undergoes
           resynchronization by the system.  In such cases, the object will
           adjust its internal state so as to maintain faithful accumulated
           times as well as it possibly can.
           [//]
           This function is not necessarily thread safe.  You should call it
           within a protected environment or ensure access from only one

           [//]
           In any case, the condition (or conditions) which
           have occurred are communicated via the `cond_flags' argument
           and the corresponding `channel' is also identified.
           [//]
           Some comments on design are in order here.  Although an
           implementation of this function can test each of the individual
           condition flags passed via `cond_flags', it could just attempt
           to perform any outstanding I/O whenever the function is
           called.  Even if the application has requested the
           `kdcs_channel_monitor' object to shutdown (as indicated by
           the `KDCS_CONDITION_MONITOR_CLOSING' flag), it is still
           appropriate to attempt I/O on the `kdcs_channel' object and
           detect such unusual conditions via exceptions which are thrown.
           For more on this, consult the exceptions documented for
           the `kdcs_tcp_channel' object's connect, accept, read and write
           functions.
         [ARG: cond_flags]
           Logical OR of one or more of the flags `KDCS_CONDITION_READ',
           `KDCS_CONDITION_WRITE', `KDCS_CONDITION_CONNECT',
           `KDCS_CONDITION_ACCEPT', `KDCS_CONDITION_ERROR',
           `KDCS_CONDITION_WAKEUP' and `KDCS_CONDITION_MONITOR_CLOSING',
           indicating which conditions have occurred.
           [//]
           The first four conditions (read, write, connect and accept) have
           been cleared from the set of conditions that will be monitored for
           the channel on the next call to `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once'.
           The implementation can re-instate any of these conditions by
           re-invoking `kdcs_channel_monitor::queue_conditions' (typically
           done by I/O member functions of the `kdcs_channel' object).
           [//]
           If a scheduled wakeup time has occurred, the `cond_flags' argument
           will include the `KDCS_CONDITION_WAKEUP' flag, possibly mixed with
           some of the above four flags if additional monitored conditions
           have occurred.
           [//]
           The `KDCS_CONDITION_MONITOR_CLOSING' flag means that the `monitor'
           object's `kdcs_channel_monitor::request_closure' function has been
           called.
           [//]
           If a channel error condition is detected, the `KDCS_CONDITION_ERROR'
           flag will be set, in addition to any of the `KDCS_CONDITION_READ',
           `KDCS_CONDITION_WRITE' or `KDCS_CONDITION_CONNECT' conditions which
           were being monitored when the error was detected.  This way, an
           application may either explicitly test for the
           `KDCS_CONDITION_ERROR' condition or else it may just test for the
           READ/WRITE/CONNECT condition and proceed as if errors had not
           occurred, detecting the error later when issuing the relevant
           I/O call.

     cannot be performed immediately because the channel is on the monitor's

           [//]
           You can be sure that `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' will
           not be invoked with the `KDCS_CONDITION_WAKEUP' prior to the
           `earliest' time.  It may be invoked a little after the
           `latest' time, but the purpose of providing a `latest' wakeup time
           which is later than `earliest' is to indicate how tolerant you are
           of imprecise timing.  This allows the internal machinery to avoid
           lots of short sleep cycles.
           [//]
           Note that the wakeup call is always invoked from within `run_once'
           and that function may currently be blocked on a socket `select'
           operation.  As a result, the wakeup might not be serviced until
           the `wait_microseconds' period supplied to `run_once' ellapses
           and `run_once' is called again.  In applications where `run_once'
           is invoked from a separate I/O service thread, the
           `wait_microseconds' parameter might typically be on the order of
           1 to 10 milliseconds.  If you are using scheduled wakeups for
           rate control purposes when delivering data over a socket, you
           should be aware that data delivery may be bursty at this timescale.
           In practice this is unlikely to present a problem, especially
           since bursty delivery of traffic into a socket provides more
           opportunity to estimate channel delay and transmission rate
           characteristics.
         [RETURNS]
           False if `request_closure' has been called or `ref' is invalid.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Provides a simple mechanism to signal the event on which the
           `run_once' function may be waiting if it has no conditions queued
           to wait for with `select'.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool
      run_once(int wait_microseconds, int new_condition_wait_microseconds);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Execute one iteration of the monitor run-loop.  This involves
           the following steps:
           [>>] Collect any outstanding channel monitoring conditions
                (those registered using `queue_conditions', since the last
                iteration of the run loop) and put them into the current
                "select set".
           [>>] Wait on the conditions in the "select set", until at least
                one of them occurs, or a scheduled wakeup occurs.  The function
                waits for at most `wait_microseconds' on channel conditions
                which it is monitoring.  If no condition occurs in this
                period, the function returns.  Waiting for only a limited time
                is important, since calls to `queue_conditions',
                `schedule_wakeup' and `request_closure' which arrive while
                the object is waiting on existing channel conditions will not
                be considered until the wait is complete.
           [>>] Invoke all relevant `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel'
                functions; if `request_closure' is found to have been called,
                the relevant `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' functions
                are called with the `KDCS_CONDITION_MONITOR_CLOSING' flag.
           [//]
           The function returns false if the `request_closure' function is
           found to have been called.  Otherwise, it returns true.
           [//]
           In many cases, the `run_once' function will be invoked repeatedly
           from a special channel monitoring thread until it returns false.
           However, it is possible to invoke the function from within a
           single threaded application to wait upon all pending channel
           conditions together.
         [RETURNS]
           True unless the `request_closure' function has been called, from
           this or any other thread.
         [ARG: wait_microseconds]
           Maximum time spent in the function waiting for channel conditions
           to occur.  If 0, the function effectively polls the conditions and
           then returns once any required channel servicing calls have
           completed.  A -ve value places no restriction on the time spent
           waiting; in practice, though, the function will never wait more
           than 1 second before returning, just to be on the safe side.
           In practice, it is strongly advisable to supply a value of at
           most a few thousand microseconds here, since new conditions
           identified via calls to `queue_conditions', `schedule_wakeup' or
           `request_closure' cannot be responded to until a current call to
           the system `select' function returns.  On the other hand, if the
           only way in which such conditions can be registered is through
           calls to the `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' function,
           it should be OK to wait for much longer, since that function is
           invoked only from within the present one.
         [ARG: new_condition_wait_microseconds]
           This argument affects the behaviour only if there are no channel
           conditions which need to be monitored when the function enters.
           In this case, the function waits instead on an internal `kdu_event',
           which becomes signalled whenever `queue_conditions',
           `schedule_wakeup', `wake_from_run' or `request_closure' is called.
           [//]
           If you set this argument to 0, the function returns immediately if
           there are no channel conditions to wait upon.  This is exactly what
           you should do if your application involves only one thread.
           [//]
           A negative value for this argument causes the function to wait
           indefinitely on the internal `kdu_event'.
           [//]
           Notwithstanding any of the above, the function will become unblocked
           and return if a scheduled wakeup occurs (see `schedule_wakeup').

           This static function provides a convenient means of determining

           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_IPV4_ONLY' -- in this case, the function

           test.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool
      init(const char *name, int flags);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to lookup a host name or translate a dotted
           IPv4 (decimal) or IPv6 (hexadecimal) address string, as found
           in `name'.  The name may resolve to multiple addresses, in which
           case the object's `first' and `next' functions may be used to
           navigate between them -- the `first' call is implied if the
           present function returns true.
           [//]
           This function invokes the powerful system function `getaddrinfo'
           and copies its results, retaining at most the `AF_INET'
           and `AF_INET6' addresses.  However, the function also provides
           additional features for pre-processing the `name' string based
           on the supplied `flags', as documented below.
           [//]
           As an added convenience, `name' may actually be NULL, in which
           case the function looks up the address of the current host.  If
           this fails, the function falls back to using the local host's
           loopback address.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the function is unable to recover any addresses which
           match the supplied data.
         [ARG: name]
           If NULL, the function resolves the current host's address.
           Otherwise, `name' holds either a host name to be resolved or a
           literal IP address.  The `flags' argument determines whether or
           not additional pre-processing is performed on the `name' string,
           primarily to support the translation of host details which are
           found within URI's.
         [ARG: flags]
           Logical OR of zero or more of the following flags:
           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_IPV4_ONLY' -- means that only IPv4 addresses
                will be discovered and stored in the object; this flag may
                be useful for managing interaction with systems which do not
                correctly handle IPv6.
           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_IPV6_ONLY' -- means that only IPv6 addresses
                will be discovered and stored in the object; this flag is
                useful primarily for testing IPv6 support under various
                scenarios.
           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_LITERAL_ONLY' -- means that the `name' string
                will be interpreted as a literal IPv4 or IPv6 address only;
                no attempt will be made at name resolution.  Note that this
                flag refers to the interpretation of the `name' string, whereas
                the above two flags refer to the type of results that can
                be produced by translation or name resolution.
           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_NEED_PORT' -- means that the port information
                is assumed to be invalid, so that `is_valid' will return false
                until such time as `set_port' has been called.  Nevertheless,
                if the present function returns true, you can still recover
                the addresses managed by the object via calls to `get_addr',
                `get_addr_len', `get_addr_family', `first' and `next'.
           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_BRACKETED_LITERALS' -- means that IPv6
                literal addresses are expected to be encapsulated within
                square brackets, while IPv4 literal addresses may optionally
                be encapsulated within square brackets.  Encapsulation within
                square brackets means that the first and last characters in
                `name' are `[' and `]', respectively.  If this flag is present,
                strings found within such square brackets will only be
                interpreted as IP literals and strings which do not have
                square brackets will never be interpreted as IPv6 literals.
           [>>] `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_ESCAPED_NAMES' -- means that host names are
                hex-hex decoded prior to name resolution.  Hex-hex decoding
                does not apply to IP literals.  Together, this flag and the
                `KDCS_ADDR_FLAG_BRACKETED_LITERALS' flag allow for the correct
                parsing and resolution of the host component of a URI, in
                accordance with RFC 3986.

           Use this to change the channel servicing object.
           Note that changing the channel servicing object generally
           removes any scheduled wakeups and installed I/O conditions.
           As a result, you may need to invoke `schedule_wakeup' or an
           I/O function of interest again.  In practice, this is unlikely to
           prove problematic, since you would normally only change the
           channel servicer to move it from one managing object to another.
           [//]
           This function may be used at any point after the object has a
           created `socket'.  Creating a `socket' is the responsibility of
           a derived class.  For example, `kdcs_tcp_channel::connect',
           `kdcs_tcp_channel::listen', `kdcs_tcp_channel::accept' and
           `kdcs_udp_channel::connect' all create sockets.
           [//]
           The function may be used to change a non-blocking channel to a
           blocking one (by supplying a NULL `servicer' argument) or
           vice-versa, or to change the `kdcs_channel_servicer' object used
           by a current non-blocking channel.  Internally, the actual
           socket is always configured in non-blocking mode at the operating
           system level, but we use the term "blocking" socket here to refer
           to one which has an internal `kdcs_channel_servicer' object (this

           `socket' is first created -- something done inside a derived
           object -- to the time blocking I/O on the channel fails.  Once the
           lifespan expires, I/O functions return immediately, leaving the
           channel closed if it was not already closed.
           [//]
           The lifespan only affects channels which are being used in the

class kdcs_tcp_channel : public kdcs_channel {
  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       This powerful object provides all the mechanisms you need to implement
       TCP socket communications in a wide variety of different contexts.
       [>>] In the most general (yet most complex case), all I/O calls
            (connect, accept, read and write) are inherently non-blocking,
            but failed calls register callbacks for the events of interest
            via a `kdcs_channel_servicer' object.  In this case, your
            application supplies a `kdcs_channel_monitor' object which manages
            scheduled wakeups and event monitoring for a potentially very
            large number of channels, typically running a separate event
            monitoring thread which calls `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' in
            a loop.  If you choose to use the object in this non-blocking
            fashion, the most efficient thing to do is to arrange for your
            individual `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' functions
            to perform outstanding I/O immediately when they are invoked,
            so that they can immediately re-register still pending I/O
            conditions with the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object.  The
            registration of I/O conditions itself occurs automatically
            whenever an I/O call fails to complete immediately.
       [>>] A much simpler way to interact with the object is to make all
            I/O calls block the caller until they complete (or fail
            permanently).  This model is realized if you do not supply a
            `kdcs_channel_servicer' object in the initial call to `connect',
            `listen' or `accept'.  In this case, the object implements its
            own internal `kdcs_channel_servicer', which wakes up any blocked
            I/O call to retry the operation.  With this model, you still
            provide your own external `kdcs_channel_monitor' object, but you
            have the choice of executing its `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once'
            function in a separate event monitoring thread, or directly from
            within the blocked I/O call.  The latter approach allows for
            completely single-threaded implementations.  In either case, your
            application can have other channels which execute non-blocking
            I/O calls and share the same `kdcs_channel_monitor' object; their
            their `kdcs_channel_servicer' objects will be invoked from within
            the `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function is appropriate.
       [//]
       With the wide array of options outlined above, it is a relatively
       simple matter to robustly implement client/server applications using
       a variety of programming models.  For server applications, there are
       likely to be a large number of sockets and threads and the non-blocking
       approach with immediate execution of I/O calls from within
       `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' is likely to be the most
       efficient strategy.
       [//]
       For client applications with only one channel, the blocking approach
       with in-thread execution of the `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once'
       function is simplest and entirely appropriate.  In a more complex
       client application, with multiple channels, the blocking approach
       with a single thread of execution, may still be appropriate if there
       is a single primary channel that you can readily identify to run
       the `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function (on behalf of all
       channels) when its I/O calls are blocked.
       [//]
       Note that access to this object is not inherently thread safe, even
       though the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object is thread safe.  In
       multi-threaded applications, you may need to provide some kind of
       protection against simultaneous access to the object's member
       functions from multiple threads.

           be re-invoked.

           the function themselves.  In this case, blocking calls wait upon
           an internal synchronization event that is set by the channel

           also wind up servicing other non-blocking channels which have

           by the `kdcs_channel_monitor::add_channel' function.
           [//]
           If `servicer' is NULL, the function sets up the channel for
           blocking communications and this function itself will block the
           caller until the connection is established, the connection is
           found to be unreachable, or an exception is thrown (see below).
           [//]
           If `servicer' is non-NULL, the function sets up the channel for
           non-blocking communications and this function itself will not
           block the caller.  In this case, the function returns false if
           the connection cannot be established immediately, but leaves the
           channel active (`kdcs_channel::is_active' reports true) and
           registers the `KDCS_CONDITION_CONNECT' condition with the
           channel monitor, to be passed to the `servicer->service_channel'
           function once the `connect' call should be able to proceed.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the connection attempt failed (in this case, the
           internal socket is also destroyed) or if a non-blocking
           connection attempt cannot be completed at this point (in this
           case, the `kdcs_channel::is_active' function returns true and
           the connection request has been added as a condition to be
           monitored by the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object originally supplied
           to the constructor).
           [//]
           As noted above, you can expect an exception to be thrown (rather
           than a return value) in the event that the underlying socket
           cannot be created.
           [//]
           Otherwise, one of the following exceptions may be thrown (all are
           of type `kdu_exception'):
           [>>] `KDCS_LIFESPAN_EXCEPTION' means that the lifespan has expired
                during a blocking call (see `set_blocking_lifespan').  The
                channel is left in the inactive state so that subsequent
                calls to this function start from scratch.
           [>>] `KDCS_CLOSING_EXCEPTION' means that the
                `kdcs_channel_monitor::request_closure' function has been
                called.  After this happens, the channel is left in the
                inactive state so that subsequent calls to this function
                start from scratch.
         [ARG: address]
           Note that the `address' object may actually hold more than one
           address, if a call to `kdcs_sockaddr::init' resolved multiple
           possible addresses for a given name.  This is particularly likely
           in the world of IPv6.  The function actually walks through all the
           available addresses, trying each one in turn, using the
           `kdcs_sockaddr::first' and `kdcs_sockaddr::next' functions.  The
           `address' argument itself is left unchanged, but an internal copy
           (`connect_address') is made to keep track of this address walking
           process.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is similar to `connect', except that it configures
           the internal socket to listen for incoming calls from clients,
           binding to the supplied listening `address'.  As for `connect',
           an error will be generated through `kdu_error' (or else an
           exception will be thrown directly if errors have been suppressed
           using `kdcs_channel::set_error_mode') if the socket itself cannot
           be created.  Failure to create the socket may result from an
           operating system imposed limit on the number of open sockets, or a
           limit imposed by the `monitor->add_channel' function.
           [//]
           Unlike `connect', this function does not have to be re-issued
           if it does not succeed.  No conditions need to be queued
           with the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object.  The presence (or absence)
           of a `servicer' object determines whether subsequent calls to
           `accept' will be blocking or non-blocking, but has no impact on
           whether or not the present function blocks the caller (socket
           binding is essentially immediate).
         [RETURNS]
           False if the supplied listening `address' cannot be bound.  In
           this case, the internal socket is destroyed and `is_active'
           will return false -- there is no need in this case to call
           `close', but you can if you like.
           [//]
           As noted above, you can expect an exception to be thrown (rather
           than a return value) in the event that the underlying socket
           cannot be created.
         [ARG: backlog_limit]
           Sizes the listening queue; a value greater than 1 allows multiple
           clients to be queued for `accept' calls.  If the value supplied here
           is less than 1, the value of 1 will be used.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is used to accept an incoming call on the present
           channel, which should have been configured using `listen'.  If
           successful, the function returns a newly created `kdcs_tcp_channel'
           object, which is connected for ongoing communications; the
           returned object's `kdcs_channel::is_connected' member will return
           true. It is up to you to delete this channel once you are done
           with it.
           [//]
           If the `servicer' argument supplied to `listen' was NULL, this
           function blocks the caller until a new connection can be accepted
           or an exception occurs (see below).
           [//]
           If the `servicer' argument supplied to `listen;' was non-NULL, this
           function is non-blocking.  If a connection is not already available
           to accept, the function returns NULL, but leaves the
           accept condition queued on the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object which
           was supplied during construction.  Once an incoming connection
           arrives, that object's `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function
           will invoke the `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' member
           of the `kdcs_channel_servicer' object supplied to `listen', which
           should normally re-issue the `accept' call.
           [//]
           If the function succeeds, the returned channel is constructed
           with the supplied `target_monitor' and
           `have_separate_target_monitor_thread' parameters (see the
           `kdcs_tcp_channel' constructor's description for more on these).
           Also, the returned channel is initially assigned the supplied
           `target_servicer' object for servicing non-blocking I/O calls. If
           NULL, the returned object is initially configured for blocking I/O
           but you can change this later by invoking `set_channel_servicer'.
         [RETURNS]
           NULL if the channel is non-blocking and no incoming call
           can be accepted at this time.  You can generally re-invoke the
           function at a later time.
           [//]
           This function may generate an error via `kdu_error' if it is
           not possible to create a new socket or to add it to the
           `target_monitor' object for monitoring (e.g., a socket/channel
           limit is exceeded).  As with the other I/O functions, an
           exception might be thrown immediately, rather than calling
           `kdu_error', if the present object's `kdcs_channel::set_error_mode'
           function has been used to suppress errors.
           [//]
           Otherwise, one of the following exceptions (all of type
           `kdu_exception') may be thrown:
           [>>] `KDCS_LIFESPAN_EXCEPTION' means that the lifespan has expired
                during a blocking call (see `set_blocking_lifespan').  The
                channel is not automatically closed, however, so it is
                possible to change the lifespan and re-initiate I/O if you
                so-desire.

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       This object provides all the mechanisms you need to implement UDP
       socket communications in a wide variety of different contexts.
       [>>] In the most general (yet most complex case), all I/O calls
            (send and recv) are inherently non-blocking, but failed calls
            register callbacks for the events of interest via a
            `kdcs_channel_servicer' object.  In this case, your
            application supplies a `kdcs_channel_monitor' object which manages
            scheduled wakeups and event monitoring for a potentially very
            large number of channels, typically running a separate event
            monitoring thread which calls `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' in
            a loop.  If you choose to use the object in this non-blocking
            fashion, the most efficient thing to do is to arrange for your
            individual `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel' functions
            to perform outstanding I/O immediately when they are invoked,
            so that they can immediately re-register still pending I/O
            conditions with the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object.  The
            registration of I/O conditions itself occurs automatically
            whenever an I/O call fails to complete immediately.
       [>>] A much simpler way to interact with the object is to make all
            I/O calls block the caller until they complete (or fail
            permanently).  This model is realized if you do not supply a
            `kdcs_channel_servicer' object in the initial call to `connect'.
            In this case, the object implements its own internal
            `kdcs_channel_servicer', which wakes up any blocked
            I/O call to retry the operation.  With this model, you still
            provide your own external `kdcs_channel_monitor' object, but you
            have the choice of executing its `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once'
            function in a separate event monitoring thread, or directly from
            within the blocked I/O call.  The latter approach allows for
            completely single-threaded implementations.  In either case, your
            application can have other channels which execute non-blocking
            I/O calls and share the same `kdcs_channel_monitor' object; their
            their `kdcs_channel_servicer' objects will be invoked from within
            the `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function is appropriate.
       [//]
       Note that access to this object is not inherently thread safe, even
       though the `kdcs_channel_monitor' object is thread safe.  In
       multi-threaded applications, you may need to provide some kind of
       protection against simultaneous access to the object's member
       functions from multiple threads.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Does not actually create a socket.  All the real work of
           establishing a channel that can be used for socket communications
           of one form or another is done by `connect'.
         [ARG: monitor]
           This argument must not be NULL.  All channels need to have a
           `kdcs_channel_monitor' which can be used to unblock blocking I/O
           calls or to serve notification that non-blocking I/O calls should
           be re-invoked.
           [//]
           In most applications, there will be only one `kdcs_channel_monitor'
           object, shared by all communication channels.  However, it is
           possible to create separate monitors if you have a good reason
           for doing this.
         [ARG: have_separate_monitor_thread]
           If true, blocking I/O calls to this object will assume that the
           `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function is being executed from
           a separate channel monitoring thread and not attempt to execute
           the function themselves.  In this case, blocking calls wait upon
           an internal synchronization event that is set by the channel
           monitoring thread through relevant calls to an internal
           channel servicer object's `kdcs_channel_servicer::service_channel'
           function.
           [//]
           If false, blocking I/O calls will invoke the
           `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function themselves, until the
           call can succeed (or an exception is thrown, as documented for
           each individual I/O call below).  In the process of invoking the
           `kdcs_channel_monitor::run_once' function, a blocking call may
           also wind up servicing other non-blocking channels which have
           registered I/O conditions with the same `monitor'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Creates a socket (if required), associating it with the supplied
           local address.  If the socket already exists, this function may
           alter the local address details (IP address and port number).  The
           socket may already exist due to previous calls to `bind' and/or
           `connect'.  Otherwise, if the socket cannot be created, the function
           generates an error through `kdu_error' (in most applications, this
           results in the throwing of an exception of type `kdu_exception', but
           you can arrange for an exception to be thrown without the error
           message by using `kdcs_channel::set_error_mode').  Failure to
           create the socket may result from an operating system imposed limit
           on the number of open sockets, or a limit imposed by the
           `kdcs_channel_monitor::add_channel' function.
           [//]
           After binding, the `recv_msg' function can be used to receive a
           UDP message from any source which sends one.  However, the
           `send_msg' function cannot be used to send a UDP message unless
           `connect' has already been called or a destination address is
           explicitly passed to the `send_msg' function.
           [//]
           It is not strictly necessary to call `bind' if you intend to call
           `connect' -- in that case, a local address (and port) will be
           assigned automatically, if required.
           [//]
           If `servicer' is NULL, the function sets up the channel for
           blocking communications. Otherwise, the function sets up the
           channel for non-blocking communications.  If `bind' and `connect'
           are both used, you will probably want to pass the same `servicer'
           object to both functions; otherwise, the most recent call will
           determine the channel servicer to be used.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the bind attempt failed; in this case, the object
           is returned to its previous state (prior to the current call),
           meaning that the internal socket will be destroyed if this
           function created it.
           [//]
           As noted above, you can expect an exception to be thrown (rather
           than a return value) in the event that the underlying socket
           cannot be created.

         [ARG: local_address]
           Note that the `local_address' object may actually hold more than one
           address, if a call to `kdcs_sockaddr::init' resolved multiple
           possible addresses for a given name.  This is particularly likely
           in the world of IPv6.  The function actually walks through all the
           available addresses, trying each one in turn, using the
           `kdcs_sockaddr::first' and `kdcs_sockaddr::next' functions.  The

           server, you would typically call `bind' first and then wait for
           receipt of a message using `recv'.  Once `recv' succeeds, you
           could (optionally) invoke `connect' with the address of the

                during a blocking call (see `set_blocking_lifespan').  The
                channel is not automatically closed, however, so it is
                possible to change the lifespan and re-initiate I/O if you
                so-desire.
           [>>] `KDCS_CLOSING_EXCEPTION' means that the
                `kdcs_channel_monitor::request_closure' function has been
                called.  Before throwing this exception, the `close' function
                is called for you.  As a result, further calls to the function
                will throw the `KDCS_CLOSED_EXCEPTION' instead.
           [>>] `KDCS_CLOSED_EXCEPTION' means that the channel has been closed
                at this end -- the status of a UDP socket's destination cannot
                generally be known --  or the channel is not locally
                bound, which means that neither `bind' nor `connect' have been
                called succesfully.
         [ARG: peer_address]
           A non-NULL `peer_address' may be used to identify the peer to which
           the message is to be sent.  This argument is ignored if the
           `connect' function has been used to provide a fixed peer address.
           Otherwise, a non-NULL `peer_address' is required and an appropriate
           error will be generated through `kdu_error' if `peer_address' is
           NULL or does not hold a valid address (as determined by
           `kdcs_sockaddr::is_valid').
