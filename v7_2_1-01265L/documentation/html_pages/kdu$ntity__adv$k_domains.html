There is not normally any need for you to call this
function yourself, since work domains are automatically
advanced when the thread processes scheduled jobs,
waits upon a condition (see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A>) and when calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A> cause the domain sequence within a work domain to
advance. However, it might be useful to call this function
if a thread performs neither of the above activities
at regular intervals &mdash; this would be unusual.
</P><P>
 To understand what this function does, you should
first read the comments appearing with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A>, noting the interpretation of sequence indices. Thread
queues that schedule jobs are associated with a work
domain (identified by the 
<B>domain_name</B> argument to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A>) and also have a sequence index. In some applications,
it is very useful to advance the sequence index associated
with newly created queues in a meaningful way, so that
the jobs scheduled by these queues (and all their descendants)
are scheduled for execution only after those from queues
with earlier sequence indices, within the same domain.
Internally, each thread keeps its own notion of the
most recent sequence within each domain, from which
jobs may need to be launched. Only once all threads
have advanced their record of the most recent sequence
can the associated scheduling resources be recycled.
Although the amount of memory required for scheduling
may be small, this memory may grow indefinitely if
a thread never makes any attempt to change its notion
of the most recent sequence within the various domains
in which it can do work. As mentioned above, this might
happen if the thread never attempts to execute scheduled
jobs &mdash; note that threads which enter 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> generally execute scheduled jobs while they are waiting.
</P><P>
 Calls to the present function ensure that the calling
thread's notion of the most recent sequence within
each work domain can be advanced as required. As mentioned
above, it is highly unlikely that an application needs
to invoke this function explicitly. This is because
most applications allow worker threads to perform jobs
of limited duration (i.e., the job eventually returns
and then work domains are examined for new jobs to
perform), while the main thread that constructed the
thread group invokes either 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A>, directly or indirectly, at regular intervals.
</P><P>
 The only case in which you might need to call the
function explicitly is where the main thread or a worker
thread executing a scheduled job remains in a state
where it neither returns nor calls any of the above
mentioned functions (these are often called indirectly
from within Kakadu's data processing objects like 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>) while other threads attach queues with progressively
increasing sequence indices. Usually an application
of this form must provide some external method for
the threads to synchronize with one another since synchronization
is most naturally implemented by calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A>.
