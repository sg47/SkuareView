<P>
This function is intended to help improve the responsiveness
of interactive applications that are using timed requests.
As discussed in connection with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>, the mechanism for supporting video and animated content
with JPIP is to post a sequence of timed window of
interest requests &mdash; i.e., 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> calls with a non-zero 
<B>service_usecs</B> argument. All but the first request in such a sequence
is non-preemptive; moreover, to keep the communication
channel responsive, the client breaks long requests
down into smaller increments and tries to avoid issuing
these incremental requests to the server any earlier
than necessary, subject to full utilization of the
available communication bandwidth.
</P><P>
 The purpose of this function is to clear the client's
internal queue of as-yet unissued requests, without
actually interrupting any timed request sequence &mdash;
the caller can then append new timed requests to the
sequence. This is useful if an interactive user changes
the playback rate, the region of interest, the resolution
of interest, and so forth, since it allows the request
queue to be modified to reflect the new content of
interest, without incurring the unnecessary delay of
waiting for enqueued timed requests to complete.
</P><P>
 A similar objective could be accomplished by starting
a new sequence of timed requests, with a pre-emptive
call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>. However, pre-empting existing requests introduces
both timing uncertainty (depends on whether the server
pre-empts its own response stream) and content uncertainty
(cannot be sure which video/animation frames' content
was in flight prior to pre-emption). The present function
avoids these uncertainties by: 1) removing only those
requests that have not yet been sent to the server;
and 2) providing information regarding the cumulative
amount of requested service time that is represented
by the removed requests, so that the caller can back
up to the point that corresponds to the first unissued
request and post new requests onto the timed request
sequence, starting from that point.
</P>
</DIV>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><HR></P><H2><A NAME="ReturnS">Return Value</A></H2><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Returns the cumulative service time (measured in microseconds)
that is being reclaimed by this call. The effect is
equivalent to having posted timed requests whose 
<B>service_usecs</B> values (as supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>) were smaller in total by the returned amount. The
return value might not necessarily agree with the 
<B>service_usecs</B> values actually supplied for the discarded requests,
but it does represent the actual amount by which the
cumulative requested service time is decreased and
the cumulative requested service time is the subject
of the client's cumulative service guarantee for timed
request sequences, as discussed with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>.
</P><P>
 Typically, a video/animation application will choose
<B>service_usecs</B> values in its calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> such that the cumulative sum of these 
<B>service_usecs</B> values grows at exactly the same rate as the display
end points for the relevant animation frames. Specifically,
let E_k denote the time at which display of frame k
is supposed to end and let C_k denote the cumulative
<B>service_usecs</B> value associated with requests for frames up to and
including frame k. Then, the requested service time
for frame k is C_k - C_{k-1} and this should typically
be identical to E_k - E_{k-1}, except that the first
few frames may be assigned a reduced amount of service
to account for communication delay. After executing
the current function, suppose that the value returned
via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> corresponds to a request for frame j. Then the next
request posted via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> should be for frame j. Suppose the return value is
R. Then the application should adjust its accumulators
so that C_{j-1} = C_k-R (where k was the last frame
for which a request was posted prior to this call)
and E_{j-1} = E_k-R. After making these adjustments,
the application can post a request for frame j that
has service time E_j - E_{j-1} = E_j - (E_k-R). That
way, the gap between C_k and E_k will remain constant
into the future. In an ideal world, the return value
R is identical to the separation between original frame
end times E_k and E_{j-1}. In practice, however, the
return value may be quite different due to internal
compensation for prematurely terminated requests, channel
idle time and the impact of other request queues that
might be sharing the physical JPIP channel. As a result,
the value E_j - (E_k-R) may even turn out to be &lt;=
0, so the application might choose to skip that frame
and move on.
</P><P>
 For further guidance on the use of this function,
the reader is recommended to review the implementation
of 
<B>kdu_region_animator::generate_imagery_requests</B>, which follows the strategy outlined above, except
that it also aggregates multiple animation frames into
composite requests, to the extent that this is possible
and the aggregated "super frame" has a sufficiently
short duration.
</P><P>
 Returns -1 if the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> argument does not correspond to a valid live request
queue.
</P><P>
 Returns 0 if no requests are discarded, which invariably
happens if the request queue is not in timed request
mode &mdash; i.e., if the last posted window of interest
did not have a service time.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="queue_id">queue_id</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Identifies the request queue whose unissued requests
are to be discarded. This is one of the request queue
identifiers returned by the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> functions. If the request queue identifier is invalid
or the relevant queue is no longer alive, the function
returns -1.

</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="custom_id">custom_id</A> [<B>kdu_long</B>&nbsp;&amp;]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Used to return the custom id value of the earliest
posted window of interest for which anything was discarded.
This corresponds to the value supplied as the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> argument in the relevant call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>. If the function returns a value that is less than
or equal to 0, 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> is not modified.
</P><P>
 Typically, the application would identify the animation
frames belonging to the window of interest corresponding
to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> and issue new calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> starting from those frames.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="partially_sent">partially_sent</A> [<B>bool</B>&nbsp;&amp;]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
It is possible that the window of interest identified
via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> was internally decomposed into a sequence of requests,
some of which may have been issued by the server, so
that only some portion of the requested service time
is being discarded here. In fact, this is exactly what
we expect to happen if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> calls supply large 
<B>service_usecs</B> values. This argument is used to indicate whether
or not at least one request associated with the window
of interest with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> has been sent to the server already. As with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__tri$requests.html#custom_id">custom_id</A>, the value of this argument is not set unless the
function returns a positive value.
