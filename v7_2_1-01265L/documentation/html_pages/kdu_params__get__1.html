<P>
Retrieves a single integer (or integer compatible)
parameter (field) from the named attribute.
</P><P>
 The parameter values managed by any given attribute
are organized as an array of records, each of which
has an identical structure, defined by fields. Fields
are typed and each field in the record may have a different
type; however, the type of each field is immutable
after configuration by the relevant parameter class's
constructor. Simple field types are as follows: I (integer);
B (boolean); and F (float). The attribute definition
language used by parameter class constructors also
supports enumerated and flag field types, both of which
have integer values for the purpose of direct function
queries. The enumerated type can take on only one of
a number of pre-defined values, each of which has a
textual identifier for use in parsing and textualization.
The flag type represents a logical OR of any or all
of a set of bit flags, each of which has a pre-defined
value and associated textual identifier.
</P><P>
 The present function may be used to query field values
which may be represented as integers. This includes
boolean fields, for which a value of 0 means false
and a value of 1 means true; however, it is recommended
that you use the explicit boolean form of this function
for querying boolean valued fields.
</P><P>
 The function generates an error (through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>) if the request is incompatible with the record structure
defined for this attribute. For example, the attribute
might not support multiple records, it might not define
sufficient fields, or the identified field might not
have an integer type.
</P><P>
 If the request is legal, but the relevant field has
simply not been set, the function may return false.
Before doing so, however, it applies a set of synthesis
rules which may be used to synthesize the required
value from available information. These synthesis rules
form an essential role in effectively managing the
vast number of coding parameters which could potentially
be specified as part of a legal JPEG2000 code-stream.
It is important to note that the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html#allow_inherit">allow_inherit</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html#allow_extend">allow_extend</A> arguments may be used to override certain aspects
of the synthesis rules. We now describe the synthesis
rules themselves.
</P><P>
 If one or more values have already been supplied for
the attribute, it may be possible to extrapolate these
to satisfy a request for which data is not available.
Extrapolation is permitted only if the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html#allow_extend">allow_extend</A> argument is true (the default) and the parameter class's
constructor supplied the CAN_EXTRAPOLATE flag when
defining this attribute (calling the protected 
<B>define_attribute</B> function). Extrapolation applies only when the requested
record lies beyond the last record for which any field
values have been supplied, in which case, the function
returns the value of the indicated field from the last
available record. If the field has not been defined
in that record, the function returns false; no further
synthesis is attempted.
</P><P>
 If the attribute is empty (no field values have been
supplied for any records), the request may be passed
on to another object in the same cluster, following
the inheritance rules outlined in the discussion appearing
with the declaration of 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A>. In particular, the request is first passed on to
the tile head (object with the same tile index, but
a component index of -1), if one exists &mdash; this
object manages tile defaults for the cluster. If that
object is also unable to satisfy the request, it is
passed on to the object which has the same component
index, but a tile index of -1 &mdash; this object manages
component defaults for the cluster. If both of these
fail, the request is forwarded to the cluster head
(has both tile and component indices of -1). These
inheritance rules apply only if the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html#allow_inherit">allow_inherit</A> argument is true (the default) and only if the current
object is the head of its instance list (instance index
of 0).
</P><P>
 For non-primary instances, inheritance is not normally
available. However, some types of marker segments defined
by Part 2 of the JPEG2000 standard define an inheritance
relationship which is similar to that defined for components,
even though there are not component-specific forms.
This is most easily handled by treating the instance
index as though it were a component index for the purpose
of inheritance. Objects which are to be treated in
this way will have been constructed with the special
<B>treat_instances_like_components</B> argument set to true.

Name of the attribute, from which a single parameter
value is being queried. Attribute names are unique

well to use one of the pre-defined macros for the relevant
derived parameter class. These are documented with
the derived classes themselves.

If true, the request may be deferred to any other object

If true, the request may be satisfied by extrapolating

an index less than

If false, the function will ignore any attributes which
have been marked as holding derived quantities through
calls to the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__set_derived.html">set_derived</A> member function. This is useful when you want to inherit
attributes from objects in the same cluster, bypassing
any intermediate objects for which values might have
been automatically derived. This capability is most
useful when implementing 
<A HREF="kdu_params__finalize.html">finalize</A> functions for specific parameter classes; these functions
may have to do quite a bit of work to come up with
appropriate default values where required parameter
attributes have not been explicitly supplied.
