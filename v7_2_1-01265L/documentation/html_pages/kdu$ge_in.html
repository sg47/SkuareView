Support for reading a wide range of image file formats
is NOT a significant objective for the Kakadu tools.
Although the present object is easily extended to work
with any number of different file formats, we realize
that most application developers will prefer to use
their own (probably much more sophisticated) tools
for interacting with image files &mdash; some applications
might not need to work with uncompressed image files
at all.
</P><P>
 This class provides a uniform interface to any number
of image readers, supporting different image file formats.
Specific file format readers are selected and created
by the constructor and destroyed using the explicit
<A HREF="kdu$ge_in__destroy.html">destroy</A> function. The 
<A HREF="kdu$ge_in.html">kdu_image_in</A> object itself contains only a pointer to the internal
reader object. Copying a 
<A HREF="kdu$ge_in.html">kdu_image_in</A> object has no impact on the internal image reader,
but simply serves to provide another interface to it.
</P><P>
 An individual image file may provide one or more image
components. When multiple components are available,
each component may be accessed independently, reading
lines one by one. The object manages any buffering
required to cater for applications which read the components
at different rates, although this is not recommended.
It is also possible to access image component lines
in disjoint segments, known as tile-lines. This capability
is provided to assist tile-based compression configurations.
