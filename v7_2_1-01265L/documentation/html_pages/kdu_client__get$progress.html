This function may be used to learn about the window
which the server is currently servicing within a given
request queue, as identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> argument. To be specific, the current service window
is interpreted as the window associated with the most
recent JPIP request to which the server has sent a
reply paragraph &mdash; the actual response data may
take considerably longer to arrive, but the reply paragraph
informs the present object of the server's intent to
respond to the window, along with any dimensional changes
the server has made within its discretion.
</P><P>
 If the request queue is currently idle, meaning that
the server has finished serving all outstanding requests
for the queue, the present function will continue to
identify the most recently serviced window as the one
which is in progress, since it is still the most recent
window associated with a server reply.
</P><P>
 If the indicated request queue is not alive (i.e.,
if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> would return false when invoked with the same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> value), or if the request queue has been disconnected
using 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A>, the function returns false after invoking 
<A HREF="kdu_window__init.html">window&rarr;init</A> on any supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html#window">window</A>.
</P><P>
 Finally, if no reply has yet been received by the
server, there is considered to be no current service
window and so this function also returns false after
invoking 
<A HREF="kdu_window__init.html">window&rarr;init</A> on any supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html#window">window</A>.

True if the current service window on the indicated
request queue corresponds to the window which was most
recently requested via a call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> which returned true. Also returns true if no successful
call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> has yet been generated, but the client has received
a reply paragraph to a request which it synthesized
internally for this request queue (based on the parameters
passed to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A>). Otherwise, the function returns false, meaning that
the server has not yet finished serving a previous
window request on this queue, or a new request message
has yet to be sent to the server.

This argument may be NULL, in which case the caller
is interested only in the function's return value and/or
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html#status_flags">status_flags</A>. If non-NULL, the function modifies the various members
of this object to indicate the current service window.
</P><P>
 Note that the 
<A HREF="kdu_window.html#resolution">window&rarr;resolution</A> member will be set to reflect the dimensions of the
image resolution which is currently being served. These
can, and probably should, be used in posting new window
requests at the same image resolution.
</P><P>
 If there is no current service window, because no
server reply has ever been received for requests delivered
from this request queue, or because the queue is no
longer alive, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html#window">window</A> object will be set to its initialized state (i.e.,
the function automatically invokes 
<A HREF="kdu_window__init.html">window&rarr;init</A>).

One of the request queue identifiers returned by the
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> functions. If the request queue identifier is invalid
or the relevant queue is no longer alive, the function
returns false after invoking

You can use this argument to receive more detailed
information about the status of the request associated
with the window for which this function is returning
information. The defined flags are as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_MOST_RECENT">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_MOST_RECENT</A> &mdash; this flag is set if and only if the function
is returning true.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_STARTED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_STARTED</A> &mdash; this flag is set if at least one byte of response
data has been received for the request associated with
this window, or the response is complete.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_TERMINATED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_TERMINATED</A> &mdash; this flag is set if the server has finished
responding to the request associated with this window
and there are no internal duplicates of the request
which have been delivered or are waiting to be delivered
(internal duplicates are created to implement the client's
flow control algorithm or to synthesize virtual JPIP
channels by interleaving requests over a real JPIP
channel).
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE</A> &mdash; this flag is set if the server has finished
responding to the request associated with this window
and the response data renders the client's knowledge
of the source complete, with respect to the requested
elements. There is no need to post any further requests
with the same parameters, although doing so will cause
no harm. Note that an initial call to this function
might return the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_TERMINATED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_TERMINATED</A> flag without the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE</A> flag, while a subsequent call to the function might
report that exactly the same request is now complete
by setting the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE</A> flag. This is because there may be other request queues,
with overlapping requests in progress, and until the
response data from all such requests has been received
(possibly on separate JPIP channels), we cannot be
sure that we actually have the complete response to
this request.
