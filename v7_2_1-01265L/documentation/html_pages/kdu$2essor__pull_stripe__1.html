Decompresses new vertical stripes of samples from each
image component. The number of entries in each of the
arrays here is equal to the number of image components,
as returned by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$omponents.html">kdu_codestream::get_num_components</A> with its optional 
<B>want_output_comps</B> argument set to true &mdash; note that this value
is affected by calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> which may have been made prior to supplying the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object to 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>. Each stripe spans the entire width of its image component,
which must be no larger than the ratio between the
corresponding entries in the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#row_gaps">row_gaps</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#sample_gaps">sample_gaps</A> arrays.
</P><P>
 Each successive call to this function advances the
vertical position within each image component by the
number of lines identified within the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#stripe_heights">stripe_heights</A> array. Although components nominally advance from
the top to the bottom, if 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">kdu_codestream::change_appearance</A> was used to flip the appearance of the vertical dimension,
the function actually advances the true underlying
image components from the bottom up to the top. This
is exactly what one should expect from the description
of 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">kdu_codestream::change_appearance</A> and requires no special processing in the implemenation
of the present object.
</P><P>
 Although considerable flexibility is offered with
regard to stripe heights, there are a number of constraints.
As a general rule, you should endeavour to advance
the various image components in a proportional way,
when processing incrementally (as opposed to decompressing
the entire image into a single buffer, with a single
call to this function). What this means is that the
stripe height for each component should, ideally, be
inversely proportional to its vertical sub-sampling
factor. If you do not intend to decompress the components
in a proportional fashion, the following notes should
be taken into account:
</P><UL><LI>
If the image happens to be tiled, then you must follow
the proportional processing guideline at least to the
extent that no component should fall sufficiently far
behind the rest that the object would need to maintain
multiple open tile rows simultaneously.
</LI><LI>
If a code-stream colour transform (ICT or RCT) is being
used, you must follow the proportional processing guideline
at least to the extent that the same stripe height
must be used for the first three components (otherwise,
internal application of the colour transform would
not be possible).
</LI></UL><P>
 In addition to the constraints and guidelines mentioned
above regarding the selection of suitable stripe heights,
it is worth noting that the efficiency (computational
and memory efficiency) with which image data is decompressed
depends upon how your stripe heights interact with
image tiling. If the image is untiled, you are generally
best off working with small stripes, unless your application
naturally provides larger stripe buffers. If, however,
the image is tiled, then the implementation is most
efficient if your stripes happen to be aligned on vertical
tile boundaries. To simplify the determination of suitable
stripe heights (all other things being equal), the
present object provides a convenient utility, 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__get$_heights.html">get_recommended_stripe_heights</A>, which you can call at any time.
</P><P>
 To understand the interpretation of the sample byte
values retrieved by this function, consult the comments
appearing with the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#precisions">precisions</A> argument below. Other forms of the overloaded 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html">pull_stripe</A> function are provided to allow for the accurate representation
of higher precision image samples.
</P><P>
 Certain internal paths involve heavily optimized data
transfer routines that may exploit the availability
of SIMD instructions. Currently, optimizations exists
at least for SSSE3-capable x86 processors, under the
following conditions:
</P><UL><LI>
Conversion from all but the 32-bit absolute integer
representation (high precision reversible processing)
to buffer organizations with a sample-gap of 1 (i.e.,
separate memory blocks for each component).
</LI><LI>
Conversion from all but the 32-bit absolute integer
representation (high precision reversible processing)
to sample interleaved buffers with a sample-gap of
3 (e.g., RGB interleaved).
</LI><LI>
Conversion from all but the 32-bit absolute integer
representation (high precision reversible processing)
to sample interleaved buffers with a sample-gap of
4 (e.g., RGBA interleaved). Note that in this specific
case, the fourth component (e.g., alpha) can be synthesized
on the fly in a particularly efficient way based on
the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#pad_flags">pad_flags</A>, for the case where only 3 actual image components
are present (e.g, RGB decompressed, but RGBA written
with a dummy A value).
</LI></UL><P>
 If you are not exciting one of the above optimization
paths, you could find that the transfer of decompressed
imagery to your stripe buffers is actually the bottleneck
in the overall processing pipeline, because this part
runs in a single thread, while everything else can
potentially be heavily multi-threaded. By and large,
the above optimization paths cover almost everything
that is useful, except that the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#pad_flags">pad_flags</A> may be required to allow the internal machinery to
recognize when it can syhnthesize an extra channel
to write 4-way interleaved RGB organizations efficiently.
</P><P>
 In the event that an error is generated for some reason
through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>, this function may throw an exception &mdash; assuming
the error handler passed to 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$mize_errors.html">kdu_customize_errors</A> throws exceptions. These exceptions should be of type
<B>kdu_exception</B> or possibly of type 
<B>std::bad_alloc</B>. In any case, you should be prepared to catch such
errors in a robust application. In multi-threaded applications
(where a non-NULL 
<B>env</B> argument was passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>), you should pass any caught exception to the 
<B>env</B> object's 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">kdu_thread_entity::handle_exception</A> function. After doing this, you should still invoke
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A>, either directly or indirectly by invoking the current
object's destructor.

Array with one entry for each image component, containing
a pointer to a buffer which holds the stripe samples
for that component. The pointers may all point into
a single common buffer managed by the application,

<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#row_gaps">row_gaps</A> arrays allows the application to implement a wide

If NULL, all component precisions are deemed to be
8; otherwise, the argument points to an array with
a single precision value for each component. The precision
identifies the number of significant bits used to represent
each sample. If this value is less than 8, the remaining
most significant bits in each byte will be set to 0.
</P><P>
 There is no implied connection between the precision
values, P, and the bit-depth, B, of each image component,
as found in the code-stream's SIZ marker segment, and
returned via 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bit_depth.html">kdu_codestream::get_bit_depth</A>. The original image sample bit-depth, B, may be larger
or smaller than the value of P supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#precisions">precisions</A> argument. In any event, the most significant bit of
the P-bit integer represented by each sample byte is
aligned with the most significant bit of the B-bit
integers associated with the original compressed image
components.
</P><P>
 These conventions, provide the application with tremendous
flexibility in how it chooses to represent image sample
values. Suppose, for example, that the original image
sample precision for some component is only B=1 bit,
as recorded in the code-stream main header. If the
value of P provided by the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#precisions">precisions</A> array is set to 1, the bi-level image information
is written into the least significant bit of each byte
supplied to this function. On the other hand, if the
value of P is 8, the bi-level image information is
written into the most significant bit of each byte.
</P><P>
 The sample values recovered using this function are
always unsigned, regardless of whether or not the original
image samples had a signed or unsigned representation
(as recorded in the SIZ marker segment, and returned
via 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bit_depth.html">kdu_codestream::get_bit_depth</A>). If the original samples were signed, or the application
requires a signed representation for other reasons,
the application is responsible for level adjusting
the data returned here, subtracting 2^{P-1} from the
unsigned values.

If non-NULL, this argument points to an array with
one entry per component, which may be used to specify
additional "padding" channels that are of particular
interest for the case where R, G and B components are
interleaved with a non-existent A (alpha) component
&mdash; a common configuration. Although useful primarily
in this case, the definition is generic, as folows.

though.

If the entry for component c includes the flag 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH">KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH</A>, any inserted dummy component is padded with the maximum

If the entry for component c includes the flag 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_STRIPE_PAD_LOW">KDU_STRIPE_PAD_LOW</A>, any inserted dummy component is padded with the minimum
value (0 in this function, but may be different in
other versions of the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html">pull_stripe</A> function) that can be written to component c.
</LI><LI>
If both 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH">KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_STRIPE_PAD_LOW">KDU_STRIPE_PAD_LOW</A> are present, the latter is ignored &mdash; you should
not do this, though. If neither flag is present, the
padding value is the natural mid-point between the
two extremes.
</LI></UL><P>
 The main application for the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#pad_flags">pad_flags</A> argument is for efficiently writing to buffers that
are interleaved with a sample gap of 4, where only
3 of the interleaved slots are occupied by actual decompressed
image values. For example, suppose that components
0, 1 and 2 represents Red, Green and Blue colour samples,
all with identical dimensions, and we wish to write
the data to a buffer with 32-bit pixels. This can be
particularly efficient if we are prepared to insert
a padding value for the missing channel (say Alpha).
If Alpha goes at the end of the interleaved group and
assumes the default maximum value (typically 255, or
opaque), we would supply a 3-element 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html#pad_flags">pad_flags</A> array containing the values [0, 0 and (KDU_STRIPE_PAD_AFTER
| KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH)] If Alpha goes at the start
of the interleaved group (before Red), we would supply
[(KDU_STRIPE_PAD_BEFORE | KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH), 0,
0] If Alpha goes between Red and Green (a bit weird),
we could supply [0, (KDU_STRIPE_PAD_BEFORE | KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH),
0] or [(KDU_STRIPE_PAD_AFTER | KDU_STRIPE_PAD_HIGH),
0, 0]
