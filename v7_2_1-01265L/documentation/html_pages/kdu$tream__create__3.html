This third form of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> function is used to create what we refer to as an
<B>interchange codestream</B>, for want of a better name. There is no source and
no target for the compressed data. Code-blocks are
generally pushed into the internal code-stream management
machinery with the aid of the 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__open_block.html">kdu_precinct::open_block</A> function and assembled code-stream packets are generally
recovered using 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__get_packets.html">kdu_precinct::get_packets</A>. The 
<A HREF="kdu$bband.html">kdu_subband</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct.html">kdu_precinct</A> interfaces may ultimately be recovered from the top
level 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface by exercising appropriate functions to open
tiles, and access their tile-components, resolutions,
subbands and precincts.
</P><P>
 It is perhaps easiest to think of an 
<B>interchange codestream</B> as an 
<B>output codestream</B> (see the first form of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> function) without any compressed data target. By and
large, code-blocks are pushed into the object in the
same manner as they are for an output codestream and
this may be accomplished either by the data processing
machinery (see "kdu_sample_processing.h") or (more
commonly) by handing on code-blocks recovered from
a separate input codestream.
</P><P>
 There are a number of key points at which the behaviour
of an 
<B>interchange codestream</B> differs sigificantly from that of an 
<B>output codestream</B>. Firstly, the 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct.html">kdu_precinct</A> interface is accessible only when the internal code-stream
management machinery is created for interchange. Moreover,
when a precinct is closed (by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__close.html">kdu_precinct::close</A>), all of the associated code-block data is discarded
immediately, regardless of whether it has been put
to any good purpose or not.
</P><P>
 Interchange codestreams are primarily intended for
implementing dynamic code-stream servers. In such applications,
a separate input codestream (usually one with the persistent
mode enabled &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$ersistent.html">set_persistent</A>) is used to derive compressed data on an as-needed
basis, which is then transcoded on-the-fly into packets
which may be accessed in any order and delivered to
a client based upon its region of interest. The precinct
size adopted by the interchange codestream object may
be optimized for the communication needs of the client-server
application, regardless of the precinct size used when
compressing the separate input code-stream. Other transcoding
operations may be employed in this interchange operation,
including the insertion of error resilience information.

Plays the same role as its namesake in the first form
of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> function, used to create an 
<B>output codestream</B>. As in that case, the 
<A HREF="siz_params.html">siz_params</A> object must have been filled out (and finalized) by
the caller; an internal copy of the object is made
for use by the internal machinery.

If this argument is non-NULL, the function also constructs
the internal machinery required to manage safe multi-threaded
access and multi-threaded processing. This machinery
can be created later, however.
