This function may be used only with 
<B>input codestreams</B> (i.e., 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> created for reading from a compressed data source)
or 
<B>interchange codestreams</B> (
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> created without either a compressed source or a compressed
target). It restricts the elements of the compressed
image representation which will appear to be present.
Since the function has an impact on the dimensions
returned by other member functions, these dimensions
may need to be re-acquired afterwards. The role of
this function is closely related to that of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">change_appearance</A> member function; however, the latter function may
be applied to 
<B>output codestreams</B> as well.
</P><P>
 The function may be invoked multiple times to alter
the region of interest, resolution, image components
or number of quality layers visible to the user. However,
after the first tile is opened, the function may be
applied only to interchange codestreams or input codestreams
which are set up in the persistent mode (see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$ersistent.html">set_persistent</A>). This is because non-persistent input codestreams
discard compressed data and all associated structural
elements (tiles, subbands, etc.) once we know that
they will no longer be used &mdash; this information
is based on the input restrictions themselves. Even
in the persistent case, you may not call this function
while any tile is open.
</P><P>
 Zero valued arguments are always interpreted as meaning
that any restrictions should be removed from the relevant
parameter.
</P><P>
 There are two forms to the overloaded 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">apply_input_restrictions</A> function. The second form provides significantly more
flexibility in specifying the collection of image components
which are of interest. For both forms of the function,
however, it is possible to identify whether the image
components which are of interest belong to the class
known as "output image components" or the class known
as "codestream image components". This is determined
by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#access_mode">access_mode</A> argument which takes one of the following two values:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A> &mdash; If this access mode is selected, the collection
of visible codestream image components is determined
by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#first_component">first_component</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#max_components">max_components</A> arguments (if 0, no restrictions apply). In this case,
however, the codestream image components will be treated
as though they are also output image components, in
calls to functions such as 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get_dims.html">get_dims</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bsampling.html">get_subsampling</A> and so forth; information about any multi-component
transforms will be entirely concealed. This mode is
consistent with the services offered by Kakadu in versions
prior to v5.0, but not useful for more general applications
which may need to correctly handle Part-2 multi-component
transforms. It is set as the default value for the
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#access_mode">access_mode</A> argument to this function so as to ensure backward
compatibility.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A> &mdash; If this access mode is selected, the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#first_component">first_component</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#max_components">max_components</A> arguments serve (if non-zero) to restrict the collection
of output components, as found after the application
of any colour transform or inverse multi-component
transform. In this case, all original codestream components
will be visible, in the sense that calls to functions
such as 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get_dims.html">get_dims</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bit_depth.html">get_bit_depth</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get_signed.html">get_signed</A> and so forth return information for all original codestream
components. Also, if these component information functions
are accessed with the optional 
<B>want_output_comps</B> argument set to true, they will return information
associated with the (possibly restricted and/or permuted)
output image components. Even though all original codestream
image components are visible, the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__acc$_component.html">kdu_tile::access_component</A> function will return an empty interface if you attempt
to access any tile-component which is not actually
involved in the reconstruction of any visible output
image component within that tile. These components
are discarded immediately during codestream parsing,
if the non-persistent input mode is being used (see
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$ersistent.html">set_persistent</A>). As mentioned above, it can happen that some tile-components
are not used in the reconstruction of any output image
component at all, regardless of whether restrictions
are imposed. These tile-components will never be accessible
in the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A> mode. If there is no Part-2 multi-component transform,
there is a 1-1 correspondence between output image
components and codestream image components, except
possibly where the Part-1 reversible or irreversible
colour transform (RCT or ICT) is used (this may vary
from tile to tile), in which case the first three codestream
image components will always be accessible, if any
of the first three output components is made visible.

<P>
Identifies the index (starting from 0) of the first
component to be presented to the user. If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#access_mode">access_mode</A> is equal to 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A>, this is the first apparent codestream component and
it will also appear to be the first apparent output
component, since output and codestream components become
equivalent in this mode. If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#access_mode">access_mode</A> is equal to 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A>, this is the first apparent output component, while
all codestream components will be apparent.

</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="max_components">max_components</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Identifies the maximum number of codestream image components
which will appear to be present, starting from the
component identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#first_component">first_component</A> argument. If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#max_components">max_components</A> is 0, all remaining components will appear. As with
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#first_component">first_component</A>, the interpretation of the components which are being
restricted depends upon the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#access_mode">access_mode</A> argument.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="discard_levels">discard_levels</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Indicates the number of highest resolution levels which
will not appear to the user. Image dimensions are essentially
divided by 2 to the power of this number. This argument
affects the apparent dimensions and number of DWT levels
in each tile-component. Note, however, that neither
this nor any other argument has any effect on the parameter
sub-system, as accessed through the 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A> object (actually the head of a multi-dimensional list
of parameter objects) returned by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__access_siz.html">access_siz</A> function.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html#discard_levels">discard_levels</A> exceeds the number of DWT levels in some tile-component,
it will still be possible to open the relevant tile
successfully; however, any attempt to access the problem
tile-component's resolutions (
<A HREF="kdu$_comp__acc$esolution__1.html">kdu_tile_comp::access_resolution</A>) will cause an error message to be generated through
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>. The minimum number of DWT levels across all tile-components
is incrementally determined as tiles are opened; the
current value is reported via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$wt_levels.html">get_min_dwt_levels</A> function.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="max_layers">max_layers</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Identifies the maximum number of quality layers which
will appear to be present when precincts or code-blocks
are accessed. A value of 0 has the interpretation that
all layers should be retained.

<P>
If NULL, any region restrictions are removed. Otherwise,
provides a region of interest on the high resolution
grid. Any attempt to access tiles or other subordinate
partitions which do not intersect with this region
will result in an error being generated through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>. Note that the region may be larger than the actual
image region. Also, the region must be described in
terms of the original code-stream geometry. Specifically
any appearance transformations supplied by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">change_appearance</A> member function have no impact on the interpretation
of the region. You may find the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__map_region.html">map_region</A> member function useful in creating suitable regions.
