This function plays a very similar role to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>, except that it attempts to coerce the relevant queues
to enter the "finished" state prematurely. This is
done initially by invoking 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::request_termination</B> on the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> (if non-NULL and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A> is false) or on each of its descendants (if non-NULL
and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A> is true) or on all top-level queues (if 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is NULL). Thereafter, the function actually just invokes
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>.
</P><P>
 What actually happens depends upon the implementation
of the 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::request_termination</B> function. The base implementation of that overridable
virtual function, which should always be invoked from
any override, ensures that as soon as the queue's 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::all_done</B> function is invoked, all of its descendants will also
receive a call to their 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::request_termination</B> function. In this way, termination requests ripple
down the queue hierarchy as each queue responds to
its own request by invoking its 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::all_done</B> function. Ideally, this happens quickly.
</P><P>
 Normally, a queue should invoke its 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::all_done</B> function only once it has finished all work, which
means that its descendants should expect that they
will not be accessed by data processing agents associated
with any parent queue. Assuming that queue hierarchies
correspond to work hierarchies, implemented through
derived instances of the 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> class, this means that once a queue has received a
call to its 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::request_termination</B> function, there should be no need for it to respond
to any further requests to process new data. Normally,
the queue should avoid all future scheduling of jobs
once it receieves the termination request and arrange
to invoke its 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::all_done</B> function as soon as the last outstanding schedule
job has finished executing. It is perfectly reasonable
also for the individual jobs to terminate their work
prematurely, as soon as they detect that their queue
has received a termination request.
</P><P>
 What all this means is that the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> function is designed with the objective of orderly
premature shutdown in mind. There is no guarantee that
work which has already been launched will be completed
in the usual way after 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> has been called, although the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> call does not affect other queues which are independent
of those being terminated.
</P><P>
 As with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>, this function will never throw an exception. Instead,
all internal exceptions are caught. However, if any
thread in the group invokes the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A> function, either before or after this function is
called, the function will produce a return value of
false. The exception itself may be recovered via a
non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#exc_code">exc_code</A> argument.
</P><P>
 Handling of false returns is discussed extensively
in connection with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> function &mdash; the same considerations apply to
both 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>.

False if any thread in the group invoked its 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A> function either before or during the execution of
this function. Handling of this case is discussed extensively
in connection with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> function.

If NULL, the function issues termination requests to
all top-level queues and waits until they have all
identified themselves as "finished". Otherwise, only
those jobs which are related to the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> are affected by the call, according to the interpretation
supplied by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A>.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is non-NULL, but is not currently attached to the
thread group, the function does not have to wait on
anything before returning true; however, if an exception
has occurred, the function will return false only after
waiting to be sure that no other threads are executing
scheduled jobs, unless they are themselves waiting
within 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>.

If true and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is non-NULL, only those queues which are descendants
of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> will be terminated and waited upon. Otherwise, the
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> will also be terminated and waited upon. Only those
queues that are waited upon are actually removed from
the system once done. Thus, if 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A> is true and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is non-NULL, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> will still be "added" into the thread group when this
function returns &mdash; i.e., there is no need to
add it back again via 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A>.

If non-NULL, the referenced variable will be set to
the value of the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html#exc_code">exc_code</A> which was passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A> by any failed thread. This is meaningful only if the
function returns false. Note that a special value of
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MEMORY_EXCEPTION">KDU_MEMORY_EXCEPTION</A> means that a 
<B>std::bad_alloc</B> exception was caught and saved. If you intend to rethrow
the exception after this function returns, you should
ideally check for this value and rethrow the exception
as 
<B>std::bad_alloc</B>.
