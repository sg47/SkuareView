<P>
This function provides a convenient (and potentially
expandable) mechanism to identify semantic links between
elements in the metanode hierarchy. At present, any
node satisfying all of the following conditions is
considered to be a link:
</P><UL><LI>
The node must be represented by a cross-reference box.
</LI><LI>
The cross-reference box's fragment list must identify
exactly one contiguous range of bytes from the same
original file.
</LI><LI>
The cross-reference box must point to the box associated
with another node in the metanode hierarchy; for nodes
with descendants, it may point either to the association
box or to the node's immediate box, which is necessarily
the first sub-box of its association box. It is illegal
for cross-reference boxes to point to other cross-reference
boxes, but a link node might effectively reference
another link node if that node has a containing asoc
box.
</LI></UL><P>
 If all the above conditions are satisfied, the function
sets the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A> argument to one of 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_GROUPING_LINK">JPX_GROUPING_LINK</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK</A>, the interpretations of which are given below, returning
the target of the link or an empty interface (if the
target of the link cannot be completely read).
</P><P>
 It is important to remember that when the ultimtae
source of data is a dynamic cache, the function may
initially be unable to resolve a link. If the first
two conditions above are satisfied, but the target
of the link has not yet been resolved, so long as the
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#try_to_resolve">try_to_resolve</A> argument is true, the function will attempt to resolve
the target by parsing a minimal set of boxes that have
not yet been completely parsed. It does this by recursively
descending into the metadata hierarchy, following and
parsing only those nodes whose byte range encloses
that found in the cross-reference box. If the function
determines that there can be no valid link target,
it sets 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A> to 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE">JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE</A> and returns an empty interface. It does the same if
the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#try_to_resolve">try_to_resolve</A> argument is false and no target has yet been resolved.
However, if 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#try_to_resolve">try_to_resolve</A> is true and the function's attempt to resolve the
target of a potential link was inconclusive (i.e.,
more data must be received in the ultimate data dynamic
cache before a conclusion can be reached), the function
sets 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A> to 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING">JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING</A> and returns an empty interface.
</P><P>
 It is worth summarizing the above description from
an alternate perspective. When the ultimate source
of data is a dynamic cache, there are two potentially
transitory conditions that may cause the function to
return an empty interface:
</P><UL><LI>
The node is known to hold a link to another (target)
node, but that link target has not itself cannot be
completely read. Note that if this is the case, the
function does actually attempt to parse the link target
here, so as to take advantage of any newly arrived
data. If this fails to recover the identity and contents
of the link's target node, the function returns an
empty interface, but it sets 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A> to one of 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_GROUPING_LINK">JPX_GROUPING_LINK</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK</A>, from which the caller may infer that the link has
been resolved.
</LI><LI>
The node is known to contain a cross-reference to a
single contiguous region within the same file, that
might or might not correspond to another metadata node.
If 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#try_to_resolve">try_to_resolve</A> is false, the function makes no attempt to resolve
this byte range into a link target and simply sets
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A> to 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE">JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE</A>. If the link is subsequently resolved (e.g., through
a call to 
<A HREF="jpx$nager__load_matches.html">jpx_meta_manager::load_matches</A> or while executing any of the other functions that
perform parsing on demand &mdash; notably, 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$1escendant.html">get_next_descendant</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$2escendant.html">get_prev_descendant</A>), the current node will be added to the list of touched
nodes, from which it can be discovered using 
<A HREF="jpx$nager__get$hed_nodes.html">jpx_meta_manager::get_touched_nodes</A>. If, however, 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#try_to_resolve">try_to_resolve</A> is true, the function will make an attempt here to
resolve the cross-referenced byte range into a link
target, which may yield a valid link target, may find
that there is no valid link target, or may remain inconclusive.
In the last case, and only then, the function will
set 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A> to the special value 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING">JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING</A>. The function may be called again at a later time
in an attempt to resolve the pending link or determine
it to be unresolvable. Alternatively, the application
may wait until other parsing activities add the node
to the touched list from which the application might
later retrieve it via 
<A HREF="jpx$nager__get$hed_nodes.html">jpx_meta_manager::get_touched_nodes</A>.

Used to return one of the following link types, providing
additional semantics, which are inferred by Kakadu
based on reasonable assumptions concerning cross-referencing
and the use of asoc boxes:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE">JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE</A> &mdash; the present node is not a cross-reference
box or else the cross-reference cannot (at least for
the moment) be resolved as a link to another node in
the metadata hierarchy.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING">JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING</A> &mdash; the present node is a cross-reference box
that references a single contiguous region within the
same file that might potentially correspond to another
node in the metadata hierarchy with one of the link
types described below; however, despite the fact that
an attempt has been made to resolve the link target
(the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#try_to_resolve">try_to_resolve</A> argument must be true to get this value for 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html#link_type">link_type</A>), the status of the potential link remains unresolved.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_GROUPING_LINK">JPX_GROUPING_LINK</A> &mdash; if the cross-reference box itself is the first
sub-box of an 
<B>asoc</B> (association) box, Kakadu interprets it as a grouping
link. A grouping link serves to identify the remaining
boxes in the 
<B>asoc</B> box as members of a group associated with the link
target. In the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> hierarchy, these additional boxes are represented
as the descendants of the link node. If some of these
descendants are themselves grouping links, their descendants
belong to multiple groups. Non-grouping links are necessarily
leaves in the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode.html">jpx_metanode</A> tree hierarchy. Grouping link nodes are particularly
special because they can be the target of other links
&mdash; this is because the only way to arrange for
a cross-reference box to refer to a link node is to
refer to the node's containing 
<B>asoc</B> box (IS15444-2 makes it illegal for cross-references
to point to other cross-reference boxes). If the target
node of a grouping link is represented by the first
sub-box of an 
<B>asoc</B> box, the grouping link points to this first sub-box,
rather than the 
<B>asoc</B> box. This means that grouping link nodes may not point
to other grouping link nodes. This may at first seem
to be a weakness, but if the first sub-box of an 
<B>asoc</B> box could point to an association box, that would
be tantamount to allowing the first sub-box of an 
<B>asoc</B> box to be another 
<B>asoc</B> box, which is a semantically troublesome situation
that Kakadu deliberately does not support. Nevertheless,
grouping link nodes can refer to each other by means
of descendants with the 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK</A> type (see below).
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK</A> &mdash; if the link node is a leaf (hence not a grouping
link) and its cross-reference box points to an 
<B>asoc</B> box or to another leaf node (i.e., to any box which
is not the first sub-box of an 
<B>asoc</B> box), the link target is interpreted as an alternate
child of the link node's parent. This interpretation
agrees exactly with what would happen if the file parser
transparently walked into the cross-reference box as
though it were a local sub-box of the 
<B>asoc</B> box currently being parsed. Note that alternate child
links can legally point to other link nodes, so long
as they are grouping links &mdash; because the cross-reference
box in this case points to an asoc box rather than
another cross-reference box. As mentioned above, this
can be a useful way of explicitly linking members of
the same group together. Let A and B be two grouping
link nodes that point to the same target T. Thus, all
descendants of A and B are considered to belong to
the same group, identified by T. If we want to ensure
that T can discover its members A and B, we just need
to add alternate child links to T that point to A and
B. Alternatively, if we want to build links directly
between A and B, we can add alternate child links to
A and B as descendants of B and A, respectively. Alternate
child links to grouping link nodes makes perfect senese,
from a semantic perspective. It means that that all
the descendants of A and B could be imported as descendants
of T (in the first case) or all the descendants of
B could be imported as descendants of A or vice-versa
(in the second case) their meaning, or vice-versa,
all of which preserves the association semantics. These
kind of link arrangements can easily create cyclic
loops, so you should be careful about following links
indefintely. Kakakdu's own API functions take care
to avoid looping indefinitely while traversing the
metadata graph.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK">JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK</A> - if the link node is a leaf (hence not a grouping
link) and its cross-reference box points to the first
sub-box of an 
<B>asoc</B> box, the link target is interpreted as an alternate
parent of the link node's parent. Where alternate parents
exist, they are normally used to form bi-directional
links between two nodes A and B, as follows: A(...Lc&rarr;B...)
and B(...Lp&rarr;A...). Here, A and B are each the
first sub-box of their respective 
<B>asoc</B> boxes and parentheses are used to represent their
descendants (non-initial sub-boxes of the asoc box);
Lc&rarr;B is an alternate child link to node B (its
cross-reference box points to B itself) and Lp&rarr;A
is an alternate parent link to node A (is cross-reference
box points to the 
<B>asoc</B> box headed by A). This arrangement allows A and B
to discover each other with their proper relationships
and should cause no problems for file readers which
are not aware of Kakadu's interpretation. The arrangement
is also very useful in JPIP browsing applications,
since it forces a server to deliver A in any context
where B must be expanded and vice-versa. Evidently,
alternate-parent links may not point to other link
nodes, since that would require the cross-reference
box to reference another cross-reference box (illegal
under IS15444-2).
