<P>
This function plays an important role in managing extended
decomposition styles, as identified by JPEG2000 Part-2
<B>ADS</B> and/or 
<B>DFS</B> marker segments.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="cod_params__exp$mp_bands.html#decomp_val">decomp_val</A> argument is the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> parameter associated with a single DWT level. The
descriptors for each subband produced at that DWT level
are returned via the 
<A HREF="cod_params__exp$mp_bands.html#band_descriptors">band_descriptors</A> array, which should have at least 49 elements. The
function also returns the number of initial entries
in this array which are occupied by valid subband descriptors.
</P><P>
 Upon return, the first entry in the 
<A HREF="cod_params__exp$mp_bands.html#band_descriptors">band_descriptors</A> array always describes the low-pass subband, which
is passed on to the next DWT level, if any. The maximum
number of additional subbands which can be produced
at any level of the DWT is 48 (16 for each initial
detail subband, of which there can be at most 3 &mdash;
HL, LH and HH). Each subband identifies the exact sequence
of horizontal and vertical filtering operations which
is required to produce the subband from the low-pass
subband produced at the next higher DWT level (or from
the original image, if this is the first DWT level)
&mdash; call this the source band.
</P><P>
 The degenerate case, in which the 2 LSB's in 
<A HREF="cod_params__exp$mp_bands.html#decomp_val">decomp_val</A> are both 0, produces only one subband descriptor,
the "low-pass" subband, which is just a copy of the
image supplied to this DWT level.
</P><P>
 Each subband descriptor contains 10 meaningful bits.
Bits 0-4 (the 5 LSB's) describe the horizontal filtering
and decimation processes which produce the subband
from the source band, while bits 8-12 (the 5 LSB's
of the most significant byte in the 16-bit descriptor)
describe the vertical filtering and decimation processes
which produce the subband from the source band. There
are anywhere from 0 to 3 successive horizontal filtering
steps and 0 to 3 successive vertical filtering steps.
We describe only the first 5 bits here, corresponding
to horizontal operations, since the remaining 5 bits
play the same role for vertical operations.
</P><UL><LI>
The two-bit word in bits 0-1 holds the number of horizontal
filtering and decimation operations, in the range 0
to 3.
</LI><LI>
Bit 2 holds 1 if the first of the stages identified
above is high-pass; if there are no horizontal filtering
& decimation stages), the value of this bit is 0.
</LI><LI>
Bit 3 holds 1 if the second of the stages identified
above is high-pass; it holds 0 if there is no such
stage.
</LI><LI>
Bit 4 holds 1 if the third of the stages identified
above is high-pass; it holds 0 if there is no such
stage.

<P>
Number of subbands produced at this DWT level, including
the low-pass subband which is typically passed on to
the next decomposition level. This value is guaranteed
to lie in the range 1 to 49, where 1 is the degenerate
case of a DWT level which involves no subband decomposition
whatsoever.

<P>
Array with at least 49 elements, into which a descriptor
for each subband will be written. The format of the
descriptors is documented above. The order in which
subband descriptors are written into this array is
important. It is identical to the order in which subband
information is recorded within codestream packets and
identical to the order in which quantization information
is recorded within the QCD/QCC marker segments, bearing
in mind that the first entry in the array is not a
final subband, unless this is the last DWT level.
