Returns NULL unless 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$list_info.html">get_numlist_info</A> returned true. In that event, the function returns
a pointer to the internal array of compositing layer
indices which are recorded in the number list. This
could still be NULL, if there are no compositing layer
indices referenced by the number list. The number of
entries in the array may be found using the 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$list_info.html">get_numlist_info</A> function.
</P><P>
 Note that all layer indices start from 0 for the first
compositing layer in the JPX file. Moreover, compositing
layer indices are guaranteed to appear in order, from
smallest to largest.
</P><P>
 Note also that a number list may actually be associated
with additional (auto-replicated) compositing layers
if it is embedded within a JPX container. For more
on this, see 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$iner_lmap.html">get_container_lmap</A>.
</P><P>
 In view of the possibility of container embedding,
you are strongly recommended to avoid using this function
in any new applications that are developed. This interface
provides more generic ways of accessing the codestream
and compositing layer associations defined by a number
list node that implicitly or explicitly account for
container replication.
</P><P>
 Where the number list node records both compositing
layer indices and codestream indices, the interpretation
might not always be clear. Where necessary, Kakadu
adopts the interpretation that a number list which
records compositing layer indices is not associated
with any other compositing layers than those which
are listed, even if the other compositing layers involve
codestreams whose indices appear in the number list.
</P><P>
 When constructing JPX metadata, it is strongly recommended
that you always provide compositing layer associations,
rather than implying such associations through codestream
indices. This is because composited frames are built
from compositing instructions that reference only compositing
layers. It can be very difficult to figure out what
composited frames are associated with a given codestream,
especially if the JPX file is being served remotely
via JPIP, so that only some of the information is actually
available within a client's cache. Codestream associations
are mostly of interest for augmenting a compositing
layer association with a description of the specific
codestreams (there can be many) of the compositing
layer to which the association refers. This is important
primarily for building region-of-interest descriptions
