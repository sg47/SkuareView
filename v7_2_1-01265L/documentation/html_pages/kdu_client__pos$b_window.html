This function is conceptually similar to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>, but with the following very important differences:
</P><UL><LI>
Requests for this window of interest are associated
with a special internal "OOB queue" (read OOB as "Out-Of-Band")
that is shared by all calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html">post_oob_window</A>.
</LI><LI>
Within the internal OOB queue, requests are recorded
along with the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> values supplied the corresponding call to this function.
If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> is true, any earlier outstanding request with the
same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> is pre-empted; however, no window request posted using
this function will pre-empt one with a different 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A>. For this reason, you are expected to post only small
requests that can most likely be answered quickly.
Typically, you would only post urgent metadata-only
window requests via this function.
</LI><LI>
If possible, the object tries to associate the internal
OOB queue with its own JPIP channel so that its requests
can be handled by the server concurrently with requests
posted via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>. However, if the server does not offer sufficient
JPIP channels, the internal implementation schedules
requests from the OOB queue onto the JPIP channel which
is likely to give the fastest response &mdash; in practice,
this is any JPIP channel which is idle or, failing
that, the one whose last request was sent least recently.
Again, one should bear in mind that OOB requests will
not be pre-empted by any requests other than OOB requests
with the same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A>, so a OOB request may interrupt the regular flow of
responses on some shared JPIP channel. For these reasons,
you are expected to post only small requests that can
most likely be answered quickly.
</LI></UL><P>
 The principle motivation for this function is the
need to obtain fast responses to small metadata requests
that are generated when an interactive user clicks
on some item of metadata with a view to recovering
its descendants. Ideally, this should happen in a similar
timeframe to that which would be exhibited by a typical
web browsing application. On the other hand progressive
imagery delivery typically runs in epochs whose duration
may be on the order of 1 second or even more. The solution
is to schedule these small metadata requests on their
own JPIP channel, where one is available.
</P><P>
 Note that the internal "OOB queue" is automatically
created when this function is first invoked and it
is automatically closed once all other queues have
been closed via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A>.
</P><P>
 You can query the progress of a posted OOB window
by calling the 
<B>get_oob_window_progress</B> function.

False if the call has no effect. This may be the case
if there is already a request on the internal OOB queue
that has been fully answered and had a window of interest
that contains the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#window">window</A>. It may also be the case if there is already a containing
request on the OOB queue which has not yet been fully
answered but has the same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> is false. It may also be the case if there is a containing
request on the OOB queue which is identical in every
respect to the current one, including 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A>, regardless of whether 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> is true or not.
</P><P>
 If the function returns true, the window is held in
the internal OOB queue until a suitable request message
can be sent to the server. This message will eventually
be sent, unless a new (pre-emptive) call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html">post_oob_window</A> arrives in the mean time with the same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A>.

Arbitrary integer identifier that the caller can use
to distinguish between different requests that may
have been posted to the OOB queue. If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> is true, there will never be more than one request
with any given 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> on the OOB queue at any given time. Typically, this
function is used to collect metadata in response to
user interaction within some metadata browsing context
(e.g., something like a web browser) and the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> would identify each distinct metadata browsing context
(e.g., a browser window).

If this argument is false, a request will be queued
for the relevant window of interest. It will not pre-empt
the ongoing response to any previously posted window
with the same or a different 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A>. That said, if the OOB queue's requests need to be
interleaved onto a JPIP channel that is shared with
other request queues, requests on those queues are
temporarily pre-empted and later re-issued once the
OOB queue is empty.
</P><P>
 If you call this function with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>=true, the new window will pre-empt any undelivered
requests with the same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> and potentially pre-empt requests which have been
sent to the server but for which the server has not
yet generated the complete response, so long as the
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html#caller_id">caller_id</A> of such requests is the same.
