This is a very important function. In a way, it is
the dual of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A>, because the only ways to undo the associations created
by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A> are through 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__destroy.html">destroy</A>. Of these, the only ones that can remove specific
queues from the thread group are 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>, while 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> is actually implemented on top of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>.
</P><P>
 The function is normally invoked from the group owner,
but need not be. In fact, it is possible to create
a special thread queue with only one job, whose purpose
is to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> with other other thread queues and clean them up.
However, in this case, very special attention needs
to be paid to false returns, as explained further below.
Moreover, in this case, you should be very careful
to schedule such jobs within queues that have been
attached using the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> queue attribute in the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A> call, so as to avoid the possibility of inadvertent
deadlocks.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A> is true, the function waits for all queues descended
from 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> to identify themselves as "finished" via the 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::all_done</B> function. If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A> is false, the function also waits for the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> to identify itself as "finished". The function clears
the thread group of all internal records that might
relate to these "finished" queues before returning.
For internally allocated queues obtained using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>, the queue itself is deleted during this unlinking
process. Otherwise, you are responsible for destroying
the unlinked 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> objects that you passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A>, since these are often derived objects that may be
linked into your application in complex ways.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is NULL, this call waits for all queues in the thread
group to identify themselves as "finished" before returning.
</P><P>
 The name 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> is used because of the conceptual similarities between
this function and the notion of joining for Posix threads
(and processes). Importantly, while waiting for the
queues to finish their work, the calling thread itself
participates in any outstanding work that remains to
be done. This means that the caller may internally
get scheduled to do outstanding jobs; these may include
jobs that do not directly relate to the queues that
the caller is waiting upon. For this reason, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> is considered to place the caller in a "working wait
state", in the same way that 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> does. Working wait states are discussed in connection
with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A> function, where the spectre of deadlock is raised.
To be sure of avoiding deadlock it is best to invoke
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> only from the group owner or from a job that has been
scheduled within a queue attached using the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> attribute flag.
</P><P>
 Generally, it is safe for multiple threads to concurrently
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> with a single queue, or for threads to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> with the descendant of a super-queue which is being
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>ed by another thread. In fact, it is even allowed for
a thread which is executing 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> to indirectly call 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> again (remember that the thread is dispatched to do
other work if possible), even if it 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A>s a second time with the same queue, although these
things cannot happen if the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> calls only come from 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> jobs (see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A>) and this is advisable unless you are prepared to
conduct your own detailed analysis of the dependencies
that might be set up by a job not being able to proceed
until 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> returns.
</P><P>
 This function will never throw an exception. Instead,
all internal exceptions are caught. However, if any
thread in the group invokes the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A> function, either before or while this function is
being called, the function will produce a false return
value. The exception itself may be recovered via a
non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#exc_code">exc_code</A> argument.
</P><P>
 You may need to pay very special attention to false
return values, especially if you are using threads
in a complex manner (e.g., executing 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> from within a thread other than the thread group owner).
Here are the things you should know (the considerations
apply equally to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>):
</P><UL><LI>
If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> returns false, it tries to ensure that all processing
associated with the queues that are being waited upon
has completed. Since an exception has occurred, no
thread will execute any new jobs after those that are
currently being executed finish. With this in mind,
the most natural approach is to wait until no thread
is executing scheduled jobs. This can work well if
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> are not themselves invoked from within scheduled jobs
(see 
<B>kdu_thread_queue::schedule_jobs</B>); in this typical case, the caller is also necessarily
the thread group owner.
</LI><LI>
To cater for cases where 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> are invoke from within a scheduled job, if an exception
occurs or has occurred, and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> are invoked from within a scheduled job, the function
actually waits until every thread is either not executing
a scheduled job or else waiting within 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>. In this way, deadlock is avoided, but one cannot
be sure of the order in which 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> calls return false in different threads, in the event
of an exception.
</LI><LI>
In view of the above considerations, if you do call
this function from within a scheduled job and it returns
false, the safest policy is to immediately throw an
exception (of type 
<B>kdu_exception</B>) avoiding the temptation to access resources that
might be asynchronously cleaned up in another thread
that was also waiting in 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>.

If NULL, the function waits until all queues in the
thread group identify themselves as "finished". Otherwise,
only those jobs which are related to the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> must complete, according to the interpretation supplied
by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A>.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is non-NULL, but is not currently attached to the
thread group, the function does not have to wait on
anything before returning true; however, if an exception
has occurred, the function will return false only after
waiting to be sure that no other threads are executing
scheduled jobs, unless they are themselves waiting
within 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>.

If true and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is non-NULL, only those queues which are descendants
of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> will be waited upon. Otherwise, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> will also be waited upon. Only those queues that are
waited upon are actually removed from the system. Thus,
if 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#descendants_only">descendants_only</A> is true and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is non-NULL, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> will still be "added" into the thread group when this

If non-NULL, the referenced variable will be set to
the value of the

<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A> by any failed thread. This is meaningful only if the
function returns false. Note that a special value of
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MEMORY_EXCEPTION">KDU_MEMORY_EXCEPTION</A> means that a 
<B>std::bad_alloc</B> exception was caught and saved. If you intend to rethrow
the exception after this function returns, you should
ideally check for this value and rethrow the exception
as 
<B>std::bad_alloc</B>.
