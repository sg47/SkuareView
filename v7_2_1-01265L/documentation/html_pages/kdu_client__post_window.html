Requests that a message be delivered to the server
identifying a change in the user's window of interest
into the compressed image and/or a change in the user's
service preferences. The message may not be delivered
immediately; it may not even be delivered at all, if
the function is called again specifying a different
access window for the same request queue, with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>=true, before the function has a chance to deliver
a request for the current window to the server.
</P><P>
 You should note that each request queue (as identified
by the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> argument) behaves independently, in the sense that
newly posted window requests can only preempt exising
ones within the same queue.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> is false, the nominal behaviour is to issue this window
request to the server in such a way that any outstanding
posted window request for the queue is served completely
before service of this one begins. However, this behaviour
is affected by the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> argument supplied with previously posted windows &mdash;
see the extensive discussion of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> below.
</P><P>
 It is important to note that the server may not be
willing to serve some windows of interest in the exact
form that they are requested. When this happens, the
server's response is required to identify modified
attributes of the window which it is able to service.
The client may learn about the actual window for which
data is being served by calling 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A>. The service preferences signalled by 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#prefs">prefs</A> may also affect whether or not the server actually
makes any modifications. In particular, the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WINDOW_PREF_FULL">KDU_WINDOW_PREF_FULL</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE">KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE</A> options are particularly important for manipulating
the way in which the server treats large request windows.
</P><P>
 This function may be called at any time after a request
queue is instantiated by 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>, without necessarily waiting for the connection to
be established or for sufficient headers to arrive
for a call to 
<B>open</B> to succeed. This can be useful, since it allows an
initial window to be requested, while the initial transfer
of mandatory headers is in progress, or even before
it starts, thereby avoiding the latency associated
with extra round-trip times.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> value can be used to associate each request posted
here with an application-specified identifier (defaults
to 0). One purpose of this is to make it easier to
match requests that are in progress (see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A>) with those that were posted, in applications where
many requests may be posted in sequence. The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> value also allows you to obtain detailed status information
about specific requests that have been posted (see
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html">get_window_info</A>).
</P><P>
 We now describe the role of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> argument and the concept of "timed requests". A "timed
request sequence" is initiated by issuing a pre-emptive
call to this function with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> &gt; 0; if the preceding request had 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A>&lt;=0, a new request with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> &gt; 0 will be interpreted as preemptive, regardless
of the value of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> argument, but you should avoid such usage.
</P><P>
 After this initiating 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> call, subsequent calls with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> &gt; 0 and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>=false add to the sequence of timed requests. Let T_j
denote the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> value (a time, measured in microseconds) that corresponds
to the j'th call to this function, where j=J0 corresponds
to the first call in a given timed request sequence
and j=J1 corresponds to the first call that does not
belong to the timed request sequence &mdash; this is
either a call with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A>=0 (regular request) or a request with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>=true and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A>&gt;0 (start of a new timed request sequence). Let
C_j be the cumulative service time associated with
requests J0 through to j. That is, C_j = sum_{J0&lt;=i&lt;=j}
T_i. The internal machinery aims to construct requests
in such a way that the cumulative amount of time devoted
to the transmission of response data for requests J0
through to j is approximately equal to C_j, for each
j in the range J0 &lt;= j &lt; J1. Although any given
request might receive more or less service time than
requested, these deviations should not accumulate to
yield larger mismatches over time.
</P><P>
 The cumulative service time guarantee is an important
commitment that the 
<A HREF="kdu_client.html">kdu_client</A> object makes to the application. Moreover, it commits
to measure the service time using the application's
own reference clock, so long as the application regularly
invokes the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__sync_timing.html">sync_timing</A> function. Naturally, the application must play its
part. If the application does not post requests in
a timely manner, the communication channel may go idle.
Even in this case, the internal machinery aims to honour
its service time commitment, but this is achieved by
treating channel idle time as a kind of service and
foreshortening or even discarding posted requests that
arrive too late &mdash; i.e., when faced with the situation
in which the application has not provided requests
to send, the internal implementation attributes idle
channel time as foregone service time for future posted
windows of interest. If the application does not cancel
a timed request sequence (by starting a new one or
posting a window with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A>=0), considerable idle time may accumulate, but this
is exactly the behaviour that simplifies the design
of video/animation applications. It means that the
application can supply 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> values that correspond exactly to the separation between
the display times for frames in a video or animation,
and be guaranteed that (apart from a bounded offset)
the response data will be timed to match the animation
display process.
</P><P>
 Typically, if the application's display timing changes
in some way, it is appropriate to start a new sequence
of timed requests by posting the first such request
with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>=true. If an animation completes, it is advisable for
the application to explicitly cancel any existing timed
request sequence; if the application has no specific
window of interest to post when it ends a timed request
sequence, it can cancel the sequence by calling this
function with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A>=0 and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#window">window</A>=NULL. The special NULL 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#window">window</A> argument does not actually cause a request to be sent
to the server but it does cancel the timed request
sequence.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that request queues offered by
<A HREF="kdu_client.html">kdu_client</A> may be forced to share an underlying JPIP channel,
if the server does not offer sufficient physical JPIP
channels to accommodate the request queues that the
application opens. In this case, if any of the request
queues associated with a JPIP channel has started a
timed request sequence, all request queues associated
with the channel are serviced using timed requests
&mdash; this is achieved internally by splitting non-timed
requests up into timed pieces (as many as required),
adopting service times that are in line with those
used by the queue(s) that are actually posting timed
requests. These activities should be largely transparent
to the application, except possibly for increased timing
jitter in the cumulative service times C_j. Of course,
the amount of physical channel time received by a request
queue will be reduced if it has to share the channel
with other request queues; however, the service time
will appear to be exactly what was requested (only
the data rate will appear to be lower).
</P><P>
 Timed requests may be implemented internally using
either the JPIP "len" (byte limit) request field, or
the JPIP "twait" (timed wait) request field, to the
extent that it is supported by the server.

<P>
False if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> does not refer to a request queue which is currently
alive, or if the call otherwise has no effect. Specifically,
the call returns false under one of the following conditions:
</P><UL><LI>
The supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#window">window</A> is: a subset of a recent window which is known to
have been completely delivered by the server; AND either
the request queue is idle or posting is not 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>. If this second condition does not hold, posting the
window to the queue's list of requests can serve the
purpose of pre-empting earlier requests that are in
progress or not yet sent, so the function will not
return false, even if the request is completely subsumed
by a previous completely served request. This can actually
be a useful way of temporarily halting the flow of
data from a server.
</LI><LI>
All three of the following hold: a) the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#window">window</A> is identical in every respect to the last one successfully
posted; b) the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> value is identical to that used with the last successfully
posted window; and c) either 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A> is false in this call, or the last successfully posted
window was 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>. If this last condition is not satisfied, this window
is being pre-emptively posted, while the previous one
was not, which means that this posting does have an
effect.
</LI></UL><P>
 The dependence of the last clause above upon the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> values is important for some applications. In particular,
these conditions mean that requests which have distinct
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> values will always be assigned unique slots in the
request queue, even if their windows of interest are
identical, except only in the case where it can be
determined that the request has been completely served
in full.
</P><P>
 It follows that the request queue may contain multiple
consecutive identical window requests, all but the
first of which are non-preemptive, differing only in
their 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> values &mdash; something that is not sent to the server.
From the application's point of view at least, these
will all appear as distinct requests that may be sent
to the server, unless they are pre-empted by a later
request.

This argument may be NULL, in which case the call does

If you call this function with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#preemptive">preemptive</A>=true (best for interactive image browsing), the new
window will pre-empt any undelivered requests and potentially
pre-empt requests which have been sent to the server
but for which the server has not yet generated the
complete response. That is, requests may be pre-empted
within the client's queue of undelivered requests,
or within the server's queue of unprocessed requests).
This provides a useful way of discarding a queue of
waiting non-preemptive window requests.
</P><P>
 If false, the posted window will not pre-empt previous
requests, either within the client's queue of undelivered
requests, or within the server's queue of unprocessed
requests. However, if the previous request was posted
with a non-zero 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> argument, that request will be effectively pre-empted
after it has received the relevant amount of service
time &mdash; see the detailed discussion of timed requests
above.

<P>
If non-NULL, the function updates its internal understanding
of the application's service preferences to reflect
any changes supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#prefs">prefs</A> object. These changes will be passed to the server
with the next actual request which is sent. Even if
requests are not delivered immediately, preference
changes are accumulated internally between successive
calls to this function, until a request is actually
sent to the server.
</P><P>
 It is important to note that the function does not
replace existing preferences wholesale, based upon
a 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#prefs">prefs</A> object supplied here. Instead, replacement proceeds
within "related-pref-sets", based on whether or not
any preference information is supplied within the "related-pref-set".
This is accomplished using the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs__update.html">kdu_window_prefs::update</A> function, whose documentation you might like to peruse
to understand "related-pref-sets" better.
</P><P>
 Kakadu's server currently supports quite a few of
the preference options which are offered by JPIP. Amongst
these, probably the most useful are those which affect
whether or not the requested window can be limited
by the server (
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE">KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE</A>) for the most efficient quality progressive service,
or whether the server should try to serve the whole
thing even if spatially progressive delivery is required
(
<B>KDU_WINDOW_PREF_FULLWINDOW</B>), along with those which affect the order in which
the relevant codestreams are delivered (
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD</A> or the default 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD</A>).
</P><P>
 Kakadu's demonstration viewers ("kdu_macshow" and
"kdu_winshow") use the preferences mentioned above
to facilitate the most effective interactive browsing
experience based on the way the user manipulates a
focus window.
</P><P>
 You are strongly advised NOT to supply any "required"
preferences at the moment. Although required preferences
are supported in the implementation of Kakadu's client
and server, if a server does not support some preference
option that you identify as "required" (as opposed
to just "preferred"), the server is obliged to respond
with an error message. Currently, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client.html">kdu_client</A> implementation does not provide specific handling
for preference-related error messages, so that they
will be treated like any other server error, terminating
ongoing communication. In the future, special processing
should be introduced to catch these errors and re-issue
requests without the required preference while remembering
which types of preferences are not supported by the
server.
</P><P>
 You should be aware that preferences are managed separately
for each

This argument plays an important role in animation/video
applications. If this argument is greater than 0, the
response data for this request notionally occupies
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> microseconds of transmission time on the communication
channel (or a virtual communication channel, with reduced
data rate, if there are multiple request queues sharing
the same physical JPIP channel). As mentioned in the
extensive discussion of timed request sequence above,
the internal implementation does not gurantee that
the actual amount of service time for a given request
will be exactly equal to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html#service_usecs">service_usecs</A> (it might not even be close), but it does provide

by a sequence of timed requests.
</P><P>
 Applications that are interested in using timed requests
should also invoke 
<A HREF="kdu_client__sync_timing.html">sync_timing</A> regularly, at least to reconcile any differences that
may accumulate between the application's time clock
and the one used internally to this object &mdash;
this can probably be ignored if the application bases
its timing expectations entirely upon the system real-time
clock, but it is best not to make any assumptions about
the clocks that are used.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$_horizon.html">get_timed_request_horizon</A> function also provides important guidance regarding
the point at which an application should issue the
next request in a timed sequence, so as to avoid getting
too far ahead of or behind the communication process,
which is important for maintaining a responsive service
in interactive applications.
