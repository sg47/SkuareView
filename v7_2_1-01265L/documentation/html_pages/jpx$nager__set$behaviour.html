This function is new to Kakadu version 7.0. It allows
you to customize the way in which metadata is parsed
and/or written. Such customization is provided mainly
to support compatibility across implementations of
the JPX file format metadata that may predate new box
types introduced into IS15444-2/Amd-2.
</P><P>
 A major role for this function is in customizing the
way in which special structuring boxes are handled
by the internal implementation. The special structuring
boxes currently considered are Grouping (
<B>grp_</B>) boxes and Association (
<B>asoc</B>) boxes whose first sub-box is a 
<B>free</B> box &mdash; we call these "free-asoc" boxes. These
each provide a means of structuring metadata within
the file, in a way which is intended to be completely
semantic free. There is no particular reason why an
application should be directly interested in these
structuring boxes; indeed, the interpretation of metadata
in the file should be unaltered if the contents of
each structuring box are moved out of the structuring
box &mdash; i.e., by flattening the file structure.
On the other hand, it may be that third party applications
or older versions of Kakadu do not handle structuring
boxes in a completely transparent way. This is one
reason for customizing behaviour via this function.

This argument takes a logical OR of flags which affect
the way JPX metadata content is parsed. Currently,
the only flag defined is:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METAREAD_FLATTEN_FREE_ASOCS">JPX_METAREAD_FLATTEN_FREE_ASOCS</A> &mdash; If set, Association boxes whose first sub-box
is a free box (free-asoc boxes) are treated in the
same way as Grouping boxes &mdash; that is, the contents
of these boxes are treated as if they were direct descendants
of the box in which the Association box is found. Otherwise,
these Association boxes are treated in the usual way,
signifying a node, whose box type happens to be 
<A HREF="globals.html#jp2_free_4cc">jp2_free_4cc</A> and whose remaining sub-boxes are that node's descendants.
</LI></UL><P>
 The 
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METAREAD_FLATTEN_FREE_ASOCS">JPX_METAREAD_FLATTEN_FREE_ASOCS</A> flag is set by default, if you never call this function.

This argument takes a logical OR of flags which affect
the way JPX metadata content is written. Currently,
the only flag defined is:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#JPX_METAWRITE_USE_FREE_ASOCS">JPX_METAWRITE_USE_FREE_ASOCS</A> &mdash; If set, the object uses "free-asoc" boxes
instead of Grouping boxes, to organize large collections
of region of interest (ROI) associations in an hierarchical
manner. If this flag is missing, this is done using
JPX Grouping boxes (box type 
<A HREF="globals.html#jp2_group_4cc">jp2_group_4cc</A>) &mdash; moreover, in that case the Grouping boxes
are also used to structure any large collection of
siblings within the metadata hierarchy, so as to facilitate
efficient piecemeal access via JPIP. You may wish to
set the flag if you have reason to believe that applications
consuming the generated content may not understand
Grouping boxes. This is possible, because Grouping
boxes were only introduced to the standard in Ammendment
2 of IS15444-2. On the other hand, "free-asoc" boxes
have probably only ever been used by Kakadu-based applications,
since Kakadu was the first implementation to recognize
the need for semantic-free structuring.
</LI></UL><P>
 If you never call this function, the default is to
perform full structuring with Grouping boxes.
