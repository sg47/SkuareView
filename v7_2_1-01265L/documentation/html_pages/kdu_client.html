Implements a full JPIP network client, building on
the services offered by 
<A HREF="kdu_cache.html">kdu_cache</A>.
</P><P>
 BEFORE USING THIS OBJECT IN YOUR APPLICATION, READ
THE FOLLOWING ADVICE:
</P><UL><LI>
Because errors may be generated through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> (and perhaps warnings through 
<A HREF="kdu$rning.html">kdu_warning</A>) both in API calls from your application and inside
the network management thread created by this object,
you must at least use a thread-safe message handler
(e.g., derived from 
<A HREF="kdu$1ssage.html">kdu_thread_safe_message</A>) when you configure the error and warning handlers
(see 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$mize_errors.html">kdu_customize_errors</A> and 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$ze_warnings.html">kdu_customize_warnings</A>). Your message handler is expected to throw an exception
of type 
<B>kdu_exception</B> inside 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage__flush.html">kdu_message::flush</A> if the 
<B>end_of_message</B> argument is true &mdash; much better than letting
the entire process exit, which is the default behaviour
if you don't throw an exception. Message handlers may
be implemented in a non-native language such as Java
or C#, in which case exceptions which they throw in
their override of 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage__flush.html">kdu_message::flush</A> will ultimately be converted into 
<B>kdu_exception</B>-valued C++ exceptions.
</LI><LI>
Perhaps less obvious is the fact that your error/warning
message handler must not wait for activity on the main
application thread. Otherwise, your application can
become deadlocked inside one of the API calls offered
by this function if the network management thread is
simultaneously generating an error. Blocking on the
main application thread can happen in subtle ways in
GUI applications, since many GUI environments rely
upon the main thread to dispatch all windowing messages;
indeed some are not even thread safe.
</LI><LI>
To avoid any potential problems with multi-threaded
errors and warnings in interactive environments, you
are strongly advised to implement your error/warning
message handlers on top of 
<A HREF="kdu$queue.html">kdu_message_queue</A>, which itself derives from 
<A HREF="kdu$1ssage.html">kdu_thread_safe_message</A>. This object builds a queue of messages, each of which
is bracketed by the usual 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage__sta$t_message.html">kdu_message::start_message</A> and 
<B>kdu_message::flush(true)</B> calls, which are automatically inserted by the 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$rning.html">kdu_warning</A> services. Your derived object can override 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage__flush.html">kdu_message::flush</A> to send a message to the window management thread
requesting it to iteratively invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$queue__pop_message.html">kdu_message_queue::pop_message</A> and display the relevant message text in appropriate
interactive windows. Examples of this for Windows and
MAC-OSX platforms are provided in the "kdu_winshow"
and "kdu_macshow" demo applications. If you don't do
something like this, blocking calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">kdu_client::disconnect</A>, for example, run a significant risk of deadlocking
an interactive application if the underlying platform
does not support true multi-threaded windowing.
</LI></UL><P>
 This single network client can be used for everything
from a single shot request (populate the cache based
on a single window of interest) to multiple persistent
request queues. The notion of a request queue deserves
some explanation here so that you can make sense of
the interface documentation:
</P><UL><LI>
JPIP offers both stateless servicing of requests and
stateful request sessions. You can choose which flavour
you prefer, but stateful serving of requests (in which
the server keeps track of the client's cache state)
is the most efficient for ongoing interactive communications.
</LI><LI>
A stateful JPIP session is characterized by one or
more JPIP channels, each of which has a unique identifier;
any of these channel identifiers effectively identifies
the session. You do not need to worry about the mechanics
of JPIP channels or channel identifiers when using
the 
<A HREF="kdu_client.html">kdu_client</A> API, but it is worth knowing that JPIP channels are
associated with stateful sessions and there can be
multiple JPIP channels associated with the same session.
</LI><LI>
Each JPIP channel effectively manages its own request
queue. Within the channel, new requests may generally
pre-empt earlier requests, so that the earlier request's
response may be truncated or even empty. This is generally
a good idea, since interactive users may change their
window of interest frequently and desire a high level
of responsiveness to their new interests. Pre-emptive
behaviour like this can only be managed by the JPIP
server itself in the context of a stateful session.
For stateless communications, maintaining responsiveness
is the client's responsibility.
</LI><LI>
The present object provides the application with an
interface which offers any number of real or virtual
JPIP channels, regardless of whether the server supports
stateful sessions and regardless of the number of JPIP
channels the server is capable of supporting. The abstraction
used to deliver this behaviour is that of a "request
queue".
</LI><LI>
Each request queue is associated with some underlying
communication channel. Ideally, each request queue
corresponds to a separate JPIP channel, but servers
may not offer sessions or multiple JPIP channels. If
the server offers only one stateful session channel,
for example, the client interleaves requests from the
different request queues onto that channel &mdash;
of course, this will cause some degree of pre-emption
and context swapping by the server, with efficiency
implications, but it is better than creating separate
clients with distinct caches. If the connection is
stateless, the client explicitly limits the length
of each response based upon estimates of the underlying
channel conditions, so that responsiveness will not
be lost. For stateless communications, the client always
interleaves requests from multiple request queues onto
the same underlying communication channel, so as to
avoid consuming excessive amounts of server processing
resources (stateless requests are more expensive for
the server to handle). Regardless of whether communication
is stateful or stateless, the client manages its own
version of request pre-emption. In particular, requests
which arrive on a request queue can pre-empt earlier
requests which have not yet been delivered to the server.
</LI><LI>
In addition to the explicit request queues mentioned
above, the object provides a special internal "OOB
queue" that can be used to quickly retrieve answers
to (typically short) window-of-interest requests by
posting them to the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html">post_oob_window</A> function &mdash; this is particularly useful for implementing
responsive browsing contexts for metadata while imagery
is being concurrently streamed. Here, OOB stands for
"Out-Of-Band" and the intent is to route OOB requests
around the normal queueing mechanism so as to achieve
faster responses.
</LI></UL><P>
 The following is a brief summary of the way in which
this object is expected to be used:
</P><UL><LI>
The client application uses the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> function to initiate communication with the server.
This starts a new thread of execution internally to
manage the communication process. The cache may be
used immediately, if desired, although its contents
remain empty until the server connection has been established.
The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> function always creates a single initial request queue,
which may be used to post requests even before communication
has actually been established.
</LI><LI>
The client application determines whether or not the
remote object is a JP2-family file, by invoking 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$in_length.html">kdu_cache::get_databin_length</A> on meta data-bin 0, using its 
<B>is_complete</B> member to determine whether a returned length of 0
means that meta data-bin 0 is empty, or simply that
nothing is yet known about the data-bin, based on communication
with the server so far (the server might not even have
been connected yet).
</LI><LI>
If the 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$in_length.html">kdu_cache::get_databin_length</A> function returns a length of 0 for meta data-bin 0,
and the data-bin is complete, the image corresponds
to a single raw JPEG2000 code-stream and the client
application must wait until the main header data-bin
is complete, calling 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$in_length.html">kdu_cache::get_databin_length</A> again (this time querying the state of the code-stream
main header data-bin) to determine when this has occurred.
At that time, the present object may be passed directly
to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">kdu_codestream::create</A>.
</LI><LI>
If the 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$in_length.html">kdu_cache::get_databin_length</A> function identifies meta data-bin 0 as non-empty,
the image source is a JP2-family file. The client application
uses the present object to open a 
<A HREF="jp2$y_src.html">jp2_family_src</A> object, which is then used to open a 
<A HREF="jp2_source.html">jp2_source</A> or 
<A HREF="jpx_source.html">jpx_source</A> object (or any other suitable file format parser).
In the case where a 
<A HREF="jp2_source.html">jp2_source</A> object is used (this is a relatively elementary file
format parser), the application calls 
<A HREF="jp2_source__read_header.html">jp2_source::read_header</A> until it returns true (waiting for new cache contents
between such calls); at that point, the 
<A HREF="jp2_source.html">jp2_source</A> object is passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">kdu_codestream::create</A>. In the case of a 
<A HREF="jpx_source.html">jpx_source</A> object, the application calls 
<A HREF="jpx_source__open.html">jpx_source::open</A> until it returns non-zero (waiting for new cache contents
between such calls). Many of the 
<A HREF="jpx_source.html">jpx_source</A> object's API function provide special return values
to indicate whether or not the information of interest
is available from the cache at the time when the function
is called &mdash; if not, and the application has already
posted an appropriate window of interest, it has only
to wait until more data becomes available in the cache
are retry the function.
</LI><LI>
The client application may use the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> function to disconnect from the server, while continuing
to use the cache. By contrast, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A> function both disconnects from the server (if still
connected) and discards the contents of the cache.
The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> function can also be used to delete a single request
queue (and any communication resources exclusively
associated with that request queue) while leaving others
connected.
</LI><LI>
Additional request queues may be added with the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> function. In fact, this function may be invoked any
time after the call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A>, even if communication has not yet been established
with the server. In a typical application, multiple
request queues might be associated with multiple open
viewing windows, so that an interactive user can select
distinct windows of interest (region of interest, zoom
factor of interest, components of interest, codestreams
of interest, etc.) within each viewing window.
</LI></UL><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu_client.html">kdu_client</A> object provides a number of status functions for monitoring
the state of the network connection. These are
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_active.html">is_active</A> &mdash; returns true from the point at which 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> is called, remaining true until 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A> is called, even if all connections with the server
have been dropped or none were ever completed.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> &mdash; allows you to check whether the communication
channel used by a single request queue (or by any of
the request queues) is alive. Request queues whose
underlying communication channel is still in the process
of being established are considered to be alive.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_idle.html">is_idle</A> &mdash; allows you to determine whether or not a request
queue (or all request queues) are idle, in the sense
that the server has fully responded to existing requests
on the queue, but the queue is alive.
