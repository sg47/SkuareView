This function resets the object to the empty state
and then proceeds to add instructions from the supplied
frame, starting from the last instruction (the one
whose compositing layer will be painted on top of all
the others) and working backwards (toward the background).
Each instruction contributes a single member, returned
via 
<B>get_members</B>, except for any instruction which is known to have
no impact on the region of interest. If the 
<A HREF="jpx$ander__construct__1.html#region_of_interest">region_of_interest</A> argument supplies an empty region, the region of interest
is taken to be the entire composition surface. In any
event, an instruction has no impact on the region of
interest if all imagery which it composits within that
region lies underneath an existing opaque image region.
</P><P>
 Note that it may not be possible to determine the
opacity (or even size) of potential covering imagery
if the relevant compositing layers are not yet accessible.
</P><P>
 We say that a compositing layer is "not yet accessible"
if the JPX data source is fueled by a dynamic cache
which does not yet have sufficient contents to successfully
access the layer using 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html">jpx_source::access_layer</A>. To clarify this important concept, we make the following
two points:
</P><UL><LI>
If we are able to determine that a relevant layer lies
outside the range of compositing layers which can ever
exist in the data source, we DO NOT think of the layer
as "not yet accessible". Instead, the function returns
immediately with the object in its reset state (no
members), since the frame does not really exist. The
way the JPX composition box works is that it is allowed
to define frames which use non-existent layers, but
once a reader encounters any such frame, it is supposed
to ignore that frame and all subsequent frames.
</LI><LI>
Apart from the condition mentioned above, a "not yet
accessible" layer is one for which 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html">jpx_source::access_layer</A> returns an empty interface, when called with a false
value for its 
<B>need_stream_headers</B> argument. Thus, a layer is deemed to be accessible
if all the relevant JPX/JP2 boxes have been encountered,
even if the relevant codestream main headers are not
yet available.
</LI></UL><P>
 Any instruction whose compositing layer is not yet
accessible is included in the member list, even if
it is known not to contribute to the region of interest,
except if either of the following conditions occur:
</P><UL><LI>
The composited imagery from this instruction is known
to be globally invisible (not just within the region
of interest, but not contributing to any part of the
compositing surface); or
</LI><LI>
The compositing layer already appears in some other
contributing member instruction.
</LI></UL><P>
 The reason for the above policy is that compositing
layers are not accessible only if the JPX data source
is being served by a dynamic cache, typically in a
JPIP client-server application. In order to open an
interactive viewer for the frame, all relevant compositing
layers will need to be accessible, so a JPIP query
will need to be formed which references the compositing
layers which are not currently available. The present
object is designed to facilitate the construction of
such a JPIP query.
</P><P>
 The function stops examining instructions once the
compositing surface is completely covered by opaque
imagery.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><HR></P><H2><A NAME="ReturnS">Return Value</A></H2><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
False if any of the compositing layers which might
contribute to the composited frame cannot yet be accessed
via 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html">jpx_source::access_layer</A>, when invoked with a false value for its 
<B>need_stream_headers</B> argument. In this case, calling the function again
may result in a smaller number of members being added,
since we might not yet be able to determine whether
or not a layer is opaque or even whether it is hidden
by another layer known to be opaque.
</P><P>
 As noted above, we say that a compositing layer is
not accessible only if insufficient information is
currently available to open it or determine its existence.
If we can determine that any required compositing layer
will never exist (e.g., by using 
<A HREF="jpx_source__cou$g_layers.html">jpx_source::count_compositing_layers</A>), the present function will return true, but with
the number of members set to 0. In this case, a subsequent
call to 
<A HREF="jpx$ition__access_frame.html">jpx_composition::access_frame</A>, with exactly the same frame and track index should
return an empty interface.
