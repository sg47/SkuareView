This function is provided to allow applications to
customize the contents of the reader requirements box.
The function is used both to identify the contents
of the file and also to generate "fully understand"
and "decode completely" expressions.
</P><P>
 The "fully understand" and "decode completely" expressions
are each evaluated by taking the logical AND of a collection
of sub-expressions. Each sub_expression is evaluated
by taking the logical OR of a collection of features.
If any of the features identified by the sub-expression
is available to the reader, that sub-expression evaluates
to true. If all sub-expressions evaluate to true, the
corresponding "fully understand" or "decode completely"
expression evaluates to true. If there are no sub-expressions
at all, the "fully understand" and "decode completely"
expressions also evaluate to true.
</P><P>
 For an explanation of the difference between the "fully
understand" and "decode completely" expressions, see
the comments appearing with the 
<A HREF="jpx$ility__tes$nderstand.html">test_fully_understand</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$ility__tes$ompletely.html">test_decode_completely</A> functions.
</P><P>
 In addition to the sub-expressions generated here,
the 
<A HREF="jpx_target.html">jpx_target</A> object builds its own sub-expressions to represent
the features it knows about. The features which it
knows about are those marked with an asterisk in the
list of standard features appearing with the 
<B>check_feature</B> function. If any of those features are not explicitly
used to form sub-expressions by means of the present
function, they will be formed into sub-expressions
which identify them as required both to completely
decode and to fully understand the file's contents,
wherever this makes sense.

Indicates which sub-expression of the "fully understand"
expression this feature is being added to. The index
has no particular meaning except to associate multiple
features in the same sub-expression with one another.
However, valid sub-expression indices must lie in the
range 0 to 254. The special value of 255 means that
the feature is not being added to any "fully understand"
sub-expression. This is useful if the feature is only
to be added to "decode completely" sub-expressions.
It also provides a useful mechanism for preventing
the internal object from automatically asserting that
the feature is required to fully understand the file,
if that feature is believed to have been used.
