If used with an 
<B>input codestream</B>, this function sets the maximum number of bytes which
will be read from the input code-stream. Additional
bytes will be discarded. In this case, the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$max_bytes.html#simulate_parsing">simulate_parsing</A> argument may modify the behaviour as described in
connection with that argument below.
</P><P>
 If used with an 
<B>interchange codestream</B>, the function does nothing at all.
</P><P>
 If used with an 
<B>output codestream</B>, this function enables internal machinery for incrementally
estimating the parameters which will be used by the
PCRD-opt rate allocation algorithm, so that the block
coder can be given feedback to assist it in minimizing
the number of coding passes which must be processed
&mdash; in many cases, most of the coding passes will
be discarded. Note that the actual rate allocation
performed during a call to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> member function is independent of the value supplied
here, although it is expected that 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$max_bytes.html#max_bytes">max_bytes</A> will be equal to (certainly no smaller than) the maximum
layer byte count supplied in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> call.
</P><P>
 The following cautionary notes should be observed
concerning the incremental rate control machinery enabled
when this function is invoked on an 
<B>output codestream</B>:
</P><UL><LI>
The rate control prediction strategy relies upon the
assumption that the image samples will be processed
incrementally, with all image components processed
together at the same relative rate. It is not at all
appropriate to process one image component completely,
followed by another component and so forth. It such
a processing order is intended, this function should
not be called.
</LI><LI>
The prediction strategy may inappropriately discard
information, thereby harming compression, if the compressibility
of the first part of the image which is processed is
very different to that of the last part of the image.
Although this is rare in our experience, it may be
a problem with certain types of imagery, such as medical
images which sometimes contain empty regions near boundaries.
</LI><LI>
If truly lossless compression is desired, this function
should not be called, no matter how large the supplied
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$max_bytes.html#max_bytes">max_bytes</A> value. This is because terminal coding passes which
do not lie on the convex hull of the rate-distortion
curve will be summarily discarded, violating the official
mandate that a lossless code-stream contain all compressed
bits.
</LI></UL><P>
 For both input and output codestreams, the function
should only be called prior to the point at which the
first tile is opened and it should only be called once,
if at all. The behaviour is not guaranteed at other
points, particularly in a multi-threading environment.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__restart__1.html">restart</A> is used to restart the code-stream managment machinery,
the effect of the current function is lost. It may
be restored by calling the function again after each
call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__restart__1.html">restart</A>.

The default value of this argument is false. If set
to true, the behaviour with non-persistent input code-streams
is modified as follows. Rather than simply counting
the number of bytes consumed from the compressed data
source, the function explicitly excludes all bytes
consumed while parsing packet data which does not belong
to precincts which contribute to the current spatial
region, at the current resolution, within the current
image components, as configured in any call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">apply_input_restrictions</A>. It also excludes bytes consumed while parsing packets
which do not belong to the current layers of interest,
as configured in any call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">apply_input_restrictions</A>. The byte limit applies only to those bytes which
are of interest. Moreover, in this case, the number
of bytes returned by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$tal_bytes.html">get_total_bytes</A> function will also exclude the bytes corresponding
to packets which are not of interest. If SOP markers
have been used, the cost of these may still be counted,
even for packets which would have been parsed away.

<P>
This argument is relevant only for output codestreams.
If true, the coded block data will periodically be
examined to determine whether some premature truncation
of the generated coding passes can safely take place,
without waiting until the entire image has been processed.
The purpose of this is to minimize buffering requirements.
On the other hand, periodic trimming of existing compressed
data can require a large number of accesses to memory
which is often no longer loaded in the cache.
</P><P>
 In multi-threaded environments, periodic trimming
(if allowed by this argument) is performed in a background
processing job, which can substantially avoid blocking
the ongoing processing of code-block data in other
threads. Nevertheless, this background processing job
must lock the 
<B>KD_THREADLOCK_GENERAL</B> mutex which will block certain API functions &mdash;
most notably, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__open_tile.html">kdu_codestream::open_tile</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__close.html">kdu_tile::close</A>. Thus, periodic trimming may reduce overally CPU utilization
when processing tiled imagery. Moreover, in multi-threaded
environments, periodic trimming will be disabled (regardless
of this argument) if automatic incremental flushing
has been activated via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__auto_flush.html">auto_flush</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__aut$trans_out.html">auto_trans_out</A> functions.
</P><P>
 With these things in mind, in multi-threaded environments
you should consider allowing periodic trimming only
for untiled imagery where you do not intend to use
incremental flushing, while for tiled imagery, you
should generally use incremental flushing instead of
periodic trimming, since incremental flushing is particularly
effective when there are multiple vertical tiles.
</P><P>
 Periodic trimming can be resource intensive in any
event, so if you have plenty of memory, you might do
well to avoid the option altogether.
