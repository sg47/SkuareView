<P>
Constructing an instance of this class for the primary
node of a tile-component's highest visible resolution,
will cause the constructor to recursively create instances
of the class for each successive DWT stage and also
for the block encoding process.
</P><P>
 The recursive construction process supports all wavelet
decomposition structures allowed by the JPEG2000 standard,
including packet wavelet transforms, and transforms
with different horizontal and vertical downsampling
factors. The 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#node">node</A> object used to construct the top level 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> object will typically be the primary node of a 
<A HREF="kdu$ution.html">kdu_resolution</A> object, obtained by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$ution__access_node.html">kdu_resolution::access_node</A>. In fact, for backward compatibility with Kakadu versions
4.5 and earlier, a second constructor is provided,
which does just this.
</P><P>
 The optional 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env">env</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments support a variety of multi-threaded processing
paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of multi-processor
platforms. To see how this works, consult the description
of these arguments below.

Interface to the DWT decomposition node for which the
object is being created. The analysis stage decomposes
the image entering that node into one subband for each
of the node's children. If the child node is a leaf
(a final subband), a 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> object is created to receive the data produced in
that subband. Otherwise, another 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> object is recursively constructed to process the subband
data produced by the present node.

Ignored for reversibly transformed data. In the irreversible
case, it indicates that the nominal range of data pushed
into the 
<A HREF="kdu$h_ifc__push.html">kdu_push_ifc::push</A> function will be from -0.5*R to 0.5*R, where R is
the value of the 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#normalization">normalization</A> argument. This capability is provided primarily to
allow normalization steps to be skipped or approximated
with simple powers of 2 during lifting implementations
of the DWT; the factors can be folded into quantization
step sizes. The best way to use the normalization argument
will generally depend upon the implementation of the
DWT.

<P>
If non-NULL, this argument points to an appropriately
derived ROI node object, which may be used to recover
region of interest mask information for the present
tile-component. In this case, the present function
will automatically construct an ROI processing tree
to provide access to derived ROI information in each
individual subband. The 
<B>roi::release</B> function will be called when the present object is
destroyed &mdash; possibly sooner (if it can be determined
that ROI information is no longer required).

<P>
Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
multi-threaded processing. After creating a cooperating
thread group by following the procedure outlined in
the description of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>, any one of the threads may be used to construct this
processing engine. However, you MUST TAKE CARE to create
all objects which share the same 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#allocator">allocator</A> object from the same thread.
</P><P>
 Separate processing queues will automatically be created
for each subband, allowing multiple threads to be scheduled
simultaneously to process code-block data for the corresponding
tile-component. Also, multiple tile-components may
be processed concurrently and the available thread
resources will be allocated amongst the total collection
of job queues as required.
</P><P>
 By and large, you can use this object in exactly the
same way when 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL as you would with a NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env">env</A> argument. That is, the use of multi-threaded processing
can be largely transparent. However, you must remember
the following three points:
</P><UL><LI>
All objects which share the same 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#allocator">allocator</A> must be created using the same thread. Thereafter,
the actual processing may proceed on different threads.
</LI><LI>
You must supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env">env</A> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu$h_ifc__push.html">kdu_push_ifc::push</A> function &mdash; it need not refer to the same thread
as the one used to create the object here, but it must
belong to the same thread group.
</LI><LI>
You cannot rely upon all processing being complete
until you invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A> function.
</LI></UL>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="env_queue">env_queue</A> [<A HREF ="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. When 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL, all thread queues which are created inside
this object are added as sub-queues of 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>. If 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is NULL, all thread queues which are created inside
this object are added as top-level queues in the multi-threaded
queue hierarchy. The 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> object does not directly create any 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> objects, but it passes 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> along to the 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> objects that it constructs to process each transformed
subband and each of those objects does create a thread
queue which is made a descendant of 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>.
</P><P>
 One advantage of supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is that it provides you with a single hook for joining
with the completion of all the thread queues which
are created by this object and its descendants &mdash;
see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> for more on this.
</P><P>
 A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is that it allows you to manipulate the sequencing
indices that are assigned by the thread queues created
internally &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A> for more on the role played by sequencing indices
in controlling the order in which work is actually
done. In particular, if 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is initially added to the thread group with a sequencing
index of N &gt;= 0, each 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> object created as a result of the present call will
also have a sequencing index of N.
</P><P>
 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis__kdu_analysis__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> object supplied here provides a mechanism to determine
whether or not calls to 
<B>push</B> might potentially block. This is achieved by means
of the 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">env_queue&rarr;update_dependencies</A> function that is invoked from within the 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> object, following the conventions outlined with the
definition of the 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> object's constructor. What this means is that if 
<B>env_queue&rarr;check_dependencies</B> returns false, the next call to this object's 
<A HREF="kdu$h_ifc__push.html">kdu_push_ifc::push</A> function should not block the caller. The 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> object uses a derived 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> object to automatically schedule DWT analysis jobs
only once it knows that they will not be blocked by
missing dependencies.

<H4><A NAME="flags">flags</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">

Used to access extended functionality. Currently, the
only defined flags are:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_LINE_WILL_BE_EXTENDED">KDU_LINE_WILL_BE_EXTENDED</A> &mdash; if this flag is defined, the caller is intending
to push in lines that have been created with an 
<B>extend_right</B> value of 1. That is, 
<A HREF="kdu$e_buf.html">kdu_line_buf</A> objects supplied to the 
<B>push</B> function will have an extra sample beyond the nominal
end of the line in question. Knowing this, the current
object may allocate internal storage to have the same
extended length so as to maximize the chance that internal
calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$e_buf__exchange.html">kdu_line_buf::exchange</A> will succeed in performing an efficient data exchange
without copying of sample values. This flag is provided
primarily to allow efficient DWT implementations to
work with buffers that have an equal amount of storage
for low- and high-pass horizontal subbands. In practice,
the flag will only be set for horizontal low (resp.
high) subbands that are shorter (by 1) than the corresponding
horizontal high (resp. low) subband, where the longer
subband cannot be spanned by the same number of octets
as the shorter subband; this is a relatively unusual
condition, but still worth catering for. The application
itself would not normally set this flag.
