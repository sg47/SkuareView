Manages the information associated with JPEG2000 
<B>COD</B> and 
<B>COC</B> marker segments. Tile- and component-specific forms
are allowed (in fact, required for a complete code-stream
description); however, not all attributes are allowed
to have component-specific values; these are marked
in the list below as having the 
<B>ALL_COMPONENTS</B> flag set.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "COD", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#COD_params">COD_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 NOTE: If you are going to include an 
<A HREF="atk_params.html">atk_params</A> object in the parameter list, it is important that
you link it in ahead of the 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> object. This ensures that 
<B>atk_params::finalize</B> will be called prior to 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> so that reversibility can be reliably determined from
the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kreversible">Kreversible</A> attribute if necessary.
</P><P>
 The following attributes are defined. For an explanation
of pattern strings, consult the comments appearing
with 
<A HREF="kdu_params__par$e_string__1.html">kdu_params::parse_string</A>.
</P><UL><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cycc">Cycc</A>; Pattern = "B", [ALL_COMPONENTS] &mdash; RGB to Luminance-Chrominance
conversion? Default is to convert images with 3 or
more components to a luminance-chrominance representation,
unless a Part 2 multi-component transform is being
used (i.e., 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> &gt; 0).
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmct">Cmct</A>; Pattern = "[ARRAY=2|DWT=4]", [ALL_COMPONENTS] &mdash;
This parameter should be 0 unless a Part 2 multi-component
transform is being used, in which case it contains
the logical OR of up to two flags, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmct_ARRAY">Cmct_ARRAY</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmct_DWT">Cmct_DWT</A>. The first flag should be present if and only if an
array-based multi-component transform block is associated
with the image, or the relevant tile (for tile-specific
instances of the COD marker segment). The second flag
should be present if and only if a DWT-based multi-component
transform block is associated with the image, or the
relevant tile (for tile-specific instances of the COD
marker segment). Both flags should be present if both
types of multi-component transform block are employed
for the image or tile, as appropriate. Normally, there
is no need to explicitly set this parameter yourself.
In fact, anything you do set for this parameter will
be overridden in the object's 
<B>finalize</B> member function, which inspects the relevant 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstages">Mstages</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_xforms">Mstage_xforms</A> attributes to determine which, if any, of the multi-component
transform options are being used. When reading a codestream
created by Kakadu versions prior to v6.0, you will
find that this parameter is not set, even if a multi-component
transform has been used. This is useful, since it allows
the internal machinery to transparently compensate
for an error in the multi-component transform implementation
in previous versions of Kakadu, whereby the matrix
coefficients for reversible array-based multi-component
transforms were accidentally transposed.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clayers">Clayers</A>; Pattern = "I", [ALL_COMPONENTS] &mdash; Number of
quality layers. Default is 1.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cuse_sop">Cuse_sop</A>; Pattern = "B", [ALL_COMPONENTS] &mdash; Include SOP
markers (i.e., resync markers)? Default is no SOP markers.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cuse_eph">Cuse_eph</A>; Pattern = "B", [ALL_COMPONENTS] &mdash; Include EPH
markers (marker end of each packet header)? Default
is no EPH markers.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder">Corder</A>; Pattern = "(LRCP=0,RLCP=1,RPCL=2,PCRL=3,CPRL=4)",
[ALL_COMPONENTS] Default progression order (may be
overridden by 
<B>POCorder</B>. The four character identifiers have the following
interpretation: L=layer; R=resolution; C=component;
P=position. The first character in the identifier refers
to the index which progresses most slowly, while the
last refers to the index which progresses most quickly.
Default is "LRCP". When working with the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__set__1.html">kdu_params::set</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html">kdu_params::get</A> functions, use one of the macros, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder_LRCP">Corder_LRCP</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder_RLCP">Corder_RLCP</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder_RPCL">Corder_RPCL</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder_PCRL">Corder_PCRL</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder_CPRL">Corder_CPRL</A> to set or test for specific progression orders.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Calign_blk_last">Calign_blk_last</A>; Pattern = "BB", [ALL_COMPONENTS] &mdash; If true,
the code-block partition is aligned so that the last
sample in each nominal block (ignoring the effect of
boundaries) is aligned at a multiple of the block dimension
(a power of 2). Equivalently, the first sample in each
nominal block lies at a location which is a multiple
of the block dimension, plus 1. By default (i.e., false),
the first sample of each block is aligned at a multiple
of the block dimension. The alignment is specified
separately for both dimensions, with the vertical dimension
specified first. Note that this is a Part-2 feature.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clevels">Clevels</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Number of wavelet decomposition
levels, or stages. Default is 5.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdfs">Cdfs</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Index of the DFS marker segment
used to hold Downsampling Factor Style information.
If DFS information is involved, the value of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdfs">Cdfs</A> index must be in the range 1 to 127. A value of 0
means that no DFS marker segment is referenced. This
attribute is ignored outside of the main header (i.e.,
for non-negative tile indices). You will not normally
set this parameter yourself. Rather, it is preferable
to allow 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> to find a suitable index for you. In any event, the
DFS instructions will be generated automatically by
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> in order to record downsampling style information
derived from 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A>. During marker segment reading, the DFS instructions
will be read, along with any ADS information (see 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cads">Cads</A>) in order to reconstruct the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> attribute. For a discussion of these mechanisms, see
the introductory comments appearing with the definition
of the 
<A HREF="ads_params.html">ads_params</A> class.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cads">Cads</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Index of the ADS marker segment
used to hold Arbitrary Downsampling Style information.
If ADS information is involved, the value of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cads">Cads</A> index must lie in the range 1 to 127. A value of 0
means that no ADS marker segment is referenced. You
will not normally set this parameter yourself. Rather,
it is preferable to allow 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> to find a suitable index for you. In any event, the
ADS information will be generated automatically from
information contained in 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A>. During marker segment reading, the ADS information
is used together with any DFS information (see 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdfs">Cdfs</A>) in order to reconstruct the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> attribute. For a discussion of these mechanisms, see
the introductory comments appearing with the definition
of the 
<A HREF="ads_params.html">ads_params</A> class.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A>; Pattern = "C" [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; This attribute
manages decomposition structure information for each
DWT level. For Part-1 codestreams, there will always
be exactly one value, equal to 3, which means that
the Mallat decomposition structure is being used &mdash;
this is also the default value, if you do not explicitly
specify a decomposition structure. For Part-2 codestreams,
there may be one 32-bit integer for each DWT level,
starting from the highest resolution level and working
downwards. These values contain information recovered
from (or to be written in) Part-2 ADS and DFS marker
segments. A full discussion of the interpretation assigned
to each 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> value, along with the extension of available values
to additional decomposition levels, may be found further
below.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creversible">Creversible</A>; Pattern = "B" &mdash; Reversible compression? In
the absence of any other information, the default is
irreversible. However, if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels">Ckernels</A> is 
<B>W5X3</B> the transform will be reversible. If 
<A HREF="globals.html#Catk">Catk</A> is non-zero, the reversibility can be derived from
the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Catk">Catk</A> index and the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kreversible">Kreversible</A> attribute.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels">Ckernels</A>; Pattern = "(W9X7=0,W5X3=1,ATK=-1)" &mdash; Wavelet
kedfiernels to use. Default is W5X3 for reversible
compression, W9X7 for irreversible compression, and
ATK if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Catk">Catk</A> is non-zero. When working with the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__set__1.html">kdu_params::set</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html">kdu_params::get</A> functions, use one of the macros, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels_W9X7">Ckernels_W9X7</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels_W5X3">Ckernels_W5X3</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels_ATK">Ckernels_ATK</A> to set or test for specific sets of wavelet kernels.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Catk">Catk</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; If non-zero, this attribute
holds the Index of the Arbitrary Transformation Kernel
(ATK) marker segment from which the DWT kernel should
be derived. In this case, the value must be in the
range 2 to 255 and a corresponding " 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kreversible">Kreversible</A> attribute must exist, having the same index (instance)
value. Thus, for example, if 
<B>Catk=3</B>, you must also supply a value for 
<B>Kreversible:I3</B>. This allows 
<B>cod_params::finalize</B> to deduce the required value for 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creversible">Creversible</A>. The ATK information in these parameter attributes
can also be tile-specific.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cuse_precincts">Cuse_precincts</A>; Pattern = "B" &mdash; Explicitly specify whether
or not precinct dimensions are supplied. Default is
false, unless 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cprecincts">Cprecincts</A> is used.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cprecincts">Cprecincts</A>; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Precinct dimensions (must be powers of 2). Multiple
records may be supplied, in which case the first record
refers to the highest resolution level and subsequent
records to lower resolution levels. The last specified
record is used for any remaining lower resolution levels.
Inside each record, vertical coordinates appear first.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cblk">Cblk</A>; Pattern = "II" &mdash; Nominal code-block dimensions
(must be powers of 2 and no less than 4). Actual dimensions
are subject to precinct, tile and image dimensions.
Vertical coordinates appear first. Default block dimensions
are {64,64}.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes">Cmodes</A>; Pattern = "[BYPASS=1|RESET=2|RESTART=4|CAUSAL=8|ERTERM=16|SEGMARK=32|BYPASS_E1=64|BYPASS_E2=128]"
&mdash; Block coder mode switches. Any combination
is legal. By default, all mode switches are turned
off. When working with the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__set__1.html">kdu_params::set</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html">kdu_params::get</A> functions, use the macros, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_BYPASS">Cmodes_BYPASS</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_RESET">Cmodes_RESET</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_RESTART">Cmodes_RESTART</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_CAUSAL">Cmodes_CAUSAL</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_ERTERM">Cmodes_ERTERM</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_SEGMARK">Cmodes_SEGMARK</A> 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_BYPASS_E1">Cmodes_BYPASS_E1</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_BYPASS_E2">Cmodes_BYPASS_E2</A> to set and test for specific modes. Note that BYPASS_E1
and BYPASS_E2 modes are specific to Part-2 codestreams
that conform to IS15444-2/AMD4. These modes are meaningless
unless combined with 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_BYPASS">Cmodes_BYPASS</A>, in which case the arithmetic coder is bypassed earlier
than it otherwise would be in the MR and SP coding
passes, by 2*
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_BYPASS_E2">Cmodes_BYPASS_E2</A> + 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cmodes_BYPASS_E1">Cmodes_BYPASS_E1</A> bit-planes.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cweight">Cweight</A>; Pattern = "F", Multiplier for subband weighting factors
(see 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clev_weights">Clev_weights</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cband_weights">Cband_weights</A> below). Scaling all the weights by a single quantity
has no impact on their relative significance. However,
you may supply a separate weight for each component,
or even each tile-component, allowing you to control
the relative signicance of image components or tile-components
in a simple manner.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clev_weights">Clev_weights</A>; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Weighting factors for each successive resolution level,
starting from the highest resolution and working down
to the lowest (but not including the LL band!!). The
last supplied weight is repeated as necessary. Weight
values are squared to obtain energy weights for weighted
MSE calculations. The LL subband always has a weight
of 1.0, regardless of the number of resolution levels.
However, the weights associated with all subbands,
including the LL band, are multiplied by the value
supplied by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cweight">Cweight</A>, which may be specialized to individual components
or tile-components.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cband_weights">Cband_weights</A>; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Weighting factors for each successive subband, starting
from the highest frequency subbands and working down
(i.e., HH1, LH1, HL1, HH2, ...). The last supplied
weight is repeated as necessary for all remaining subbands
(except the LL band). If 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clev_weights">Clev_weights</A> is also supplied, both sets of weighting factors are
combined (multiplied). Weight values are squared to
obtain energy weights for weighted MSE calculations.
The LL subband always has a weight of 1.0, which avoids
problems which may occur when image components or tiles
have different numbers of resolution levels. To modify
the relative weighting of components or tile-components,
including their LL subbands, use the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cweight">Cweight</A> option; its weighting factors are multiplied by those
specified using 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cband_weights">Cband_weights</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clev_weights">Clev_weights</A>. If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> attribute is used to describe more general packet
wavelet transforms, all subbands obtained by splitting
an HL, LH or HH subband will be assigned the same weight.
No mechanism is provided for specifying their weights
separately. Moreover, all three weights (HL, LH and
HH) are present for each resolution level, even if
that level only involves horizontal or vertical splitting,
and even in the degenerate case of no splitting at
all. For horizontal splitting only, subbands derived
from HX use the corresponding HL weight; HH and LH
weights are then ignored. Similarly for vertical splitting
only, subbands derived from XH use the corresponding
LH weight; HH and HL weights are then ignored.

Maro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A>; Pattern = "I", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; Maximum number
of compressed bytes (packet headers plus packet bodies)
that can be produced for each successive image resolution,
starting from the highest resolution and working down
to the lowest. The limit applies to the cumulative
number of bytes generated for the resolution in question
and all lower resolutions. If the parameter object
in which this attribute is set is global to the entire
codestream, the limit for each resolution applies to
the cumulative number of bytes up to that resolution
in all tiles and all image components. If the parameter
object is tile-specific but not component-specific,
the limit for each resolution applies to the cumulative
number of bytes up to that resolution for all image
components within the tile. If the parameter object
is component-specific, the limit applies to the cumulative
number of bytes up to the resolution in question across
all tiles, but only in that image component. Finally,
if the parameter object is component-specific and tile-specific,
the limit applies to the cumulative number of bytes
up to the resolution in question, within just that
tile-component. You can provide limits of all four
types. Moreover, you need not provide limits for all
resolutions. The initial set of byte limits applies
only to the first quality layer to be generated during
compression. Limits for additional quality layers may
be supplied by inserting zero or negative values into
the list; these are treated as layer delimiters. So,
for example, 1000,700,0,3000,2000,0,10000 provides
limits of 1000 and 700 bytes for the highest and second
highest resolutions in the first quality layer, 3000
and 2000 bytes for the same resolutions in the second
quality layer, and a limit of 10000 bytes only to the
highest resolution in the third quality layer. Any
subsequent quality layers are not restricted by this
parameter attribute. Note that each quality layer that
is affected by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> attribute should be governed by an explicit target
length or target distortion-length slope in calls to
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A> (or any of the related functions) &mdash; implicit
target lengths (corresponding to zero-valued entries
in the array of lengths passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A>) may produce unexpected outcomes when used in conjunction
with the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> attribute. Note also that 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> constraints will not currently be applied correctly
if incremental codestream flushing is used &mdash;
this can be arranged if a significant need arises for
the combined functionality. Finally, note that the
interpretation of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> attribute may be modified by the presence of a 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A> attribute.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A>; Pattern = "I", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
This attribute has meaning only when used in conjunction
with 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A>. Moreover, only component specific and tile-component
specific forms of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A> attribute are meaningful. Suppose the attribute is
applied to image component C; then the attribute directs
the rate control machinery to combine (aggregate) the
compressed bytes (packet headers plus packet bodies)
generated for each successively lower resolution of
component C with the corresponding compressed bytes
generated for a (possibly different) specified image
component, whose 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> constraints shall be used to constrain the aggregated
total. The first parameter identifies the image component
index c_0 (zero based) with which the full compressed
data tally for component C should be aggregated before
applying the corresponding 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> constraint for component c_0. The next parameter identifies
the image component index c_1 with which the next lower
resolution compressed data tally for component C should
be aggregated, and so forth. The last supplied parameter
is replicated (extrapolated) as required to cover all
resolutions for component C. The purpose of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A> attribute is to provide a means for explicitly constraining
the aggregated amount of data generated for specific
sets of image components. Multiple image components
C may direct their cumulative compressed data tallies
to be aggregated with any given other component prior
to assessing 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> constraints. If a component index supplied with the
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A> attribute identifies an image component that does
not exist, or that has no component-specific 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> constraints, no constraints will apply in regard to
that resolution of the component to which the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A> attribute belongs. Tile-component specific forms of
the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A> attribute describe the aggregation of cumulative compressed
byte counts from one tile-component with another tile-component
in the same tile, the aggregated total being subjected
to any constraints supplied via a 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> attribute for the target tile-component.
</LI></UL><P>
 We turn our attention now to a thorough discussion
of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> parameter values, as promised above. Each 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cdecomp">Cdecomp</A> record describes the subband splitting processes for
one entire DWT level, starting from the first (highest
frequency) level. All 32 bits of any given 
<B>Dstyle</B> parameter may be required to describe the splitting
structure for the relevant DWT level. The 32 bits are
divided into a sequence of 16 2-bit fields, labeled
F0 through F15, where F0 represents the least significant
2 bits and F15 represents the most significant 2 bits.
</P><P>
 F0 identifies the primary splitting process associated
with the DWT level in question. A value of F0=3 means
that the image supplied to that DWT level is split
horizontally and vertically, as in the standard Mallat
decomposition structure. This produces 3 primary detail
subbands, denoted LH, HL and HH. A value of F0=2 means
that the image is split only in the vertical direction,
producing primary detail subband XH. A value of F0=1
means that the image is split only in the horizontal
direction, producing primary detail subband HX. Finally,
the degenerate value of F0=0 means that the DWT level
does nothing at all, passing its input image along
to the next DWT level &mdash; in this case, no detail
subbands are produced at all.
</P><P>
 The values F1 through F15 describe additional subband
splitting processes, if any, which are applied to each
primary detail subband produced at the DWT level in
question. If F0=3, F1-F5 describe HL band splitting,
F6-F10 describe LH band splitting and F11-F15 describe
HH band splitting. If F0=1 or F0=2, only F1-F5 are
used to describe additional splitting for the single
detail subband (HX or XH). In the degenerate case of
F0=0, none of F1 through F15 are used. Unused fields
must all be set to 0. In the remainder of this discussion,
we describe the splitting process for a single primary
detail subband via F1-F5 (the others are the same).
</P><UL><LI>
If F1=0, the initial detail subband is not split further
</LI><LI>
If F1=1, the initial detail subband is split horizontally;
F2 and F3 then describe any further splitting of the
newly created horizontally low- and high-pass subbands,
respectively.
</LI><LI>
If F1=2, the initial detail subband is split vertically;
F2 and F3 then describe any further splitting of the
newly created vertically low- and high-pass subbands,
respectively.
</LI><LI>
If F1=3, the initial detail subband is split both horizontally
and vertically; F2 through F5 then describe any further
splitting of the newly created LL, HL, LH and HH subbands,
in that order.
</LI><LI>
Unused fields must be 0.
</LI></UL><P>
 Where required, F2 through F5 each take values in
the range 0 to 3, corresponding to no splitting, horizontal
splitting, vertical splitting and bi-directional splitting,
respectively, of subbands produced by the primary split.
</P><P>
 When the splitting structures described above are
represented by a custom text string, the following
conventions are used.
</P><UL><LI>
F0 is represented by one of the characters 
<B>-</B> (F0=0), 
<B>H</B> (F0=1), 
<B>V</B> (F0=2), or 
<B>B</B> (F0=3). This character must be followed by a colon-separated
list of additional splitting instructions, contained
within parentheses. In the degenerate case of F0=0,
there can be no further splitting instructions, but
the parentheses must still be present; this means that
the custom string must be "-()". In the case of a single
primary detail subband (F0=1 or F0=2), the parentheses
contain a single sub-string. In the case of three primary
detail subbands (F0=3), the parentheses contain three
sub-strings, separated by colons. These describe the
additional splitting instructions for the HL, LH and
HH primary subbands, in that order.

Each sub-string consists of 1, 3 or 5 characters, drawn
from the set 
<B>-</B> (meaning no-split), 
<B>H</B> (meaning horizontal split), 
<B>V</B> (meaning vertical split) and 
<B>B</B> (meaning bi-directional split).
</LI><LI>
If the sub-string commences with a 
<B>-</B>, it may contain no further characters. Evidently,
this corresponds to the case F1=0 in the above numeric
description.
</LI><LI>
If the sub-string commences with 
<B>H</B> or 
<B>V</B>, it may two further characters, describing the splitting
processes, if any, for the low- and high-pass subbands
produced by the primary split, in that order. Evidently,
these correspond to F2 and F3 in the above numeric
description. Alternatively, the sub-string may contain
only the initial 
<B>H</B> or 
<B>V</B>, in which case no further splitting occurs (F2=F3=0).
</LI><LI>
If the sub-string commences with 
<B>B</B>, it may contain four further characters, describing
the splitting processes, if any, for the LL, LH, HL
and HH subbands produced by the primary split, in that
order. Evidently, these correspond to F2 through F5
in the above numeric description. Alternatively, the
sub-string may contain only the first character, in
which case no further splitting occurs (F2=F3=F4=F5=0).
</LI></UL><P>
 It is worth giving a few examples for clarification:
</P><UL><LI>
"B(-:-:-)" means that the input image is split horizontally
and vertically, in standard Mallat style, with no further
splitting of the primary detail subbands.
</LI><LI>
"V(HH-)" means that an initial vertical split produces
only one primary detail subband at this DWT level;
this is split horizontally and the horizontal low-pass
subband produced in this way is split horizontally
again.
</LI><LI>
"B(BBBBB:BBBBB:-)" means that the image supplied to
this DWT level is split horizontally and vertically.
The HH primary subband produced by this primary split
is left as-is, while the HL and LH primary subbands
are each split into 16 uniform subbands.
</LI></UL><P>
 If insufficient records are supplied during codestream
creation, to describe the subband splitting processes
for all DWT levels, the last descriptor is simply replicated
for all lower resolution DWT levels. Note, however,
that due to the way in which the JPEG2000 Part-2 standard
defines extrapolation rules, the final splitting descriptor
must conform to the following rules:
</P><UL><LI>
The final splitting descriptor must be identical for
all of the relevant primary detail subbands. That is,
where F0=3, F(k) = F(k+5) = F(k+10) for k=1,2,3,4,5.
</LI><LI>
All active 2-bit splitting codes must be identical,
except where whole sub-levels are omitted &mdash; that
is, so long as there is no secondary splitting of the
subbands produced by splitting each primary subband.
Thus, "B(-:-:-)", "B(BBBBB:BBBBB:BBBBB)", "B(HHH:HHH:HHH)",
"V(V&mdash;)", "V(H&mdash;)", "B(V&mdash;:V&mdash;:V&mdash;)"
and "V(VVV)" are all legal terminators, while "B(B:B:-)"
and "B(V&mdash;:H&mdash;:B&mdash;)" are examples of
illegal terminators.
