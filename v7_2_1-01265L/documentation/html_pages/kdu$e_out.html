Support for writing a wide range of image file formats
is NOT a significant objective for the Kakadu tools.
Although the present object is easily extended to work
with any number of different file formats, we realize
that most application developers will prefer to use
their own (probably much more sophisticated) tools
for interacting with image files &mdash; some applications
might not need to work with uncompressed image files
at all.
</P><P>
 This class provides a uniform interface to any number
of image writers, supporting different image file formats.
Specific file format writers are selected and created
by the constructor (based on the file name suffix)
and destroyed using the explicit 
<A HREF="kdu$e_out__destroy.html">destroy</A> function. The 
<A HREF="kdu$e_out.html">kdu_image_out</A> object itself contains only a pointer to the internal
writer object. Copying a 
<A HREF="kdu$e_out.html">kdu_image_out</A> object has no impact on the internal image writer,
but simply serves to provide another interface to it.
</P><P>
 An individual image file may store one or more image
components. When multiple components are stored, each
component may be accessed independently, writing lines
one by one. The object manages any buffering required
to cater for applications which write the components
at different rates, although this is not recommended.
It is also possible to write image component lines
in disjoint segments, known as tile-lines. This capability
is provided to assist in efficient decompression of
tiled compressed imagery.
