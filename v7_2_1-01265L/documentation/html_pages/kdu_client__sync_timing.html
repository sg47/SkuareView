This function plays two important roles when working
with timed requests &mdash; requests posted to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> with a non-zero 
<B>service_usecs</B> argument. First, it notifies the client of the current
time (in microseconds), as measured by the clock that
the application is using to determine the 
<B>service_usecs</B> values that it is passing to the client. The function
compares the running rate of this clock with that of
its own internal clock to determine whether it should
make small adjustments to the service times that are
passed to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>. The intent is to honour an agreement with the application
that the cumulative service times associated with a
timed request sequence should correspond to the actual
cumulative time that is devoted to serving those requests,
measured in the time base of the application's clock.
The application's clock is not required to run at exactly
the same rate as "real time", but it is expected to
have a similar running rate &mdash; only minor corrections
are made internally, to lock the internal and external
time bases.
</P><P>
 Note that each request queue separately keeps track
of the relationship between the application's clock
and its own internal clock. This means that the application
may use clocks which run at different rates with each
request queue, although it is not obvious why it would
want to do this.
</P><P>
 The second purpose of the function is to return the
amount of time, again measured in microseconds, that
is currently expected to transpire before any sequence
of timed requests that have been posted have received
the cumulative service time requested (as supplied
via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>s 
<B>service_usecs</B> argument). If the most recent request was not a timed
request, or if the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__sync_timing.html#expect_preemptive">expect_preemptive</A> argument is true, the return value represents an estimate
of the number of microseconds that will ellapse between
a pre-emptive timed request that is posted immediately
and receipt of the first byte of response data for
that request.

<P>
It is important to realize that the function's return
values may initially be only very approximate (even
a guess) until some return data arrives from the server
in response to timed requests. However, it is expected
that the function be called regularly, so that these
guesses gradually become more reliable.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that legitimate return values may
be negative. This happens if the application has not
posted its requests in a timely fashion so that the
point at which the next request should have been posted
has already lapsed. This is not a disaster, but it
means that the next posted request in a timed sequence
may be foreshortened or even discarded, as explained
in the extensive discussion of timed requests found
in the documentation of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>.
</P><P>
 If the queue does not exist or is not alive, a negative
value with very large absolute value will be returned.
