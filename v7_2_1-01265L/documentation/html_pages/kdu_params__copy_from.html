This is a very powerful function, which is particularly
useful in implementing code-stream transcoders. The
function generates an error unless the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#source">source</A> object and the current object are both cluster heads
(i.e., they both must have tile and component indices
of -1). The function locates all entries within the
source cluster which have the indicated 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#source_tile">source_tile</A> index and all entries within the current object's
cluster which have the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#target_tile">target_tile</A> index and copies them, skipping the first 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#skip_components">skip_components</A> codestream image components of the source cluster,
selecting instances on the basis of the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#instance">instance</A> argument, and applying whatever transformations are
required (see below).
</P><P>
 If the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#source">source</A> and current objects are both the head of their respective
cluster lists, the function scans through all clusters
repeating the copying process on each one in turn.
Even if one cluster does not have a tile which matches
the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#source_tile">source_tile</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#target_tile">target_tile</A> arguments, the function continues to scan through
all the clusters. If either or both of the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#source">source</A> and current objects is not the head of its list of
clusters, the function restricts its copying to just
the one cluster. Moreover, an error is generated if
the clusters do not belong to the same class.
</P><P>
 If you wish to copy information from all tiles simultaneously,
you may use the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_all.html">copy_all</A> function; in many applications, however, it is useful
to be able to copy information on a tile-by-tile basis.
In particular, if the source parameters are being discovered
incrementally as a code-stream is being parsed (usually
the case for transcoding operations), the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_all.html">copy_all</A> function will not be appropriate, since information
from some tile headers may not yet be available.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#instance">instance</A> is -1, all instances of each tile-component are copied.
Otherwise, only the instance whoses index is equal
to the value of the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#instance">instance</A> argument is copied. If necessary, new target instances
will be created in this process.
</P><P>
 Note carefully that no 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A>-derived object will be copied if the object has already
had any record of any of its attributes set by any
means. In this event, the object is skipped, but an
attempt is still made to copy any other objects which
lie within the scope of the call, following the rules
outlined above. The intent is to copy source objects
into newly constructed (and hence empty) objects; however,
the fact that individual objects will not be overwritten
can come in handy when copying large parameter groupings,
only some of which have already been set.
</P><P>
 The actual copying operation is performed by the protected
pure virtual function, 
<B>copy_with_xforms</B>, which must be implemented by each derived class.
It is supplied the 5 arguments starting from 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#skip_components">skip_components</A>, which may be used to modify the data as it is being
copied.
</P><P>
 To ensure robust behaviour, you should be sure to
ensure that the source parameter objects have all been
finalized before invoking this function. In most cases,
you will not need to worry about doing this, because
any necessary finalization steps are performed inside
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> management system when the parameters are recovered
from a source codestream. However, if you are filling
in the source parameters yourself by means of 
<A HREF="kdu_params__par$e_string__1.html">parse_string</A> and/or 
<A HREF="kdu_params__set__1.html">set</A> calls, you should be sure to invoke 
<A HREF="kdu_params__fin$lize_all__1.html">finalize_all</A> before calling this function.
</P><P>
 It is important to realize that the source object
corresponding to a non-negative 
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#source_tile">source_tile</A> may be identical to the one which is associated with
<B>tile_idx</B>=-1 (main code-stream header defaults). Similarly,
on entry, the target object corresponding to a non-negative
<A HREF="kdu_params__copy_from.html#target_tile">target_tile</A> may also be identical to the one which is associated
with 
<B>tiel_idx</B>=-1. When both these conditions are true, the function
does not copy anything for that object, assuming that
a consistent copying operation has already been performed
for the main codestream defaults (
<B>tile_idx</B>=-1). If this is not true in your application, you
can ensure that the target objects are always copied
explicitly (possibly wasting some space). To do this,
simply invoke 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$relation.html">access_relation</A> on each target object of interest before calling the
present function, being sure to use a false value for
the 
<B>read_only</B> argument in the call to 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$relation.html">access_relation</A>. This will cause each relevant target to be assigned
its own unique object, rather than re-using a main
code-stream header default. There should be few if
any interesting applications where you need to do this.
