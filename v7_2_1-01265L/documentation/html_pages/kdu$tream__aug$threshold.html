This function plays an important role in managing the
memory consumption and data access overhead associated
with persistent input codestreams. In particular, it
controls the conditions under which certain reloadable
elements may be unloaded from memory. These elements
are as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
Whole precincts, including their code-block state structure
and compressed data, may be unloaded from memory so
long as the following conditions are satisfied: 1)
the compressed data source's 
<B>kdu_compressed_data_source::get_capabilities</B> function must advertise one of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEEKABLE">KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEEKABLE</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED">KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED</A>; 2) sufficient information must be available (PLT
marker segments or 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED">KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED</A>) to support random access into the JPEG2000 packet
data; and 3) all packets of any given precinct must
appear consecutively (in the code-stream, or in a data
source which advertises 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED">KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED</A>). These conditions are enough to ensure that unloaded
precincts can be reloaded on-demand. Precincts become
candidates for unloading if they do not contribute
to the current region of interest within a currently
open tile.
</LI><LI>
Whole tiles, including all structural state information
and compressed data, may be unloaded from memory, so
long as the compressed data source's 
<B>kdu_compressed_data_source::get_capabilities</B> function advertises one of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEEKABLE">KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEEKABLE</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED">KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED</A> capabilities. Tiles become candidates for unloading
if they are not currently open. However, once unloading
is triggered, the system attempts to unload those which
do not intersect with the current region of interest
first. Since the search for tiles which do not belong
to the current region of interest has a complexity
which grows with the number of potentially unloadable
tiles, this number is limited. You can change the limit
using the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$threshold.html">set_tile_unloading_threshold</A> function.
</LI></UL><P>
 By default, tiles and precincts are unloaded from
memory as soon as possible, based on the criteria set
out above. While this policy minimizes internal memory
consumption, it can result in quite large access overheads,
if elements of the codestream need to be frequently
re-loaded from disk and reparsed.
</P><P>
 To minimize this access burden, the internal machinery
provides two caching thresholds which you can set.
The threshold set using the present function refers
to the total amount of memory currently being consumed
by loaded precincts and tiles, including both the compressed
data and the associated structural and addressing information.
Once a precinct or a tile becomes a candidate for unloading,
it is entered on an internal list, from which it is
unloaded only if the cache threshold is exceeded. Unloading
of old precincts is contemplated immediately before
new precincts (or their packets) are loaded, while
unloading of tiles is contemplated immediately before
new tile-parts are loaded from the code-stream. Since
unloading is considered only at these points, the cache
threshold may be crossed substantially if a new precinct
or tile-part is very large, or if the application's
data access patterns are not amenable to resource recycling.
</P><P>
 The cache threshold associated with this function
starts out at 0 (meaning, unload all unloadable elements
before loading new ones) but may be augmented as required
by calling this function any number of times.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__sha$buffering.html">share_buffering</A> has been used to share buffer resources with other
codestream management machines, this function controls
the caching threshold for all participating entities.
</P><P>
 You should be aware that the internal implementation
involves quite a few approximations, in the interest
of efficiency. This is especially important for multi-threaded
applications where memory is allocated centrally and
potentially distributed to separate thread-specific
allocators. When multiple codestreams share a common
memory management engine through 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__sha$buffering.html">share_buffering</A>, the approximations may become even more conservative.
For these reasons, cache threshold of a few hundred
kBytes or less might not behave much differently from
a cache threshold of 0.
</P><P>
 This function is inherently thread-safe.
