This object provides a high level interface to the
Kakadu decompression machinery, which is capable of
satisfying the needs of most developers while providing
essentially a one-function-call solution for simple
applications. Most new developers will probably wish
to base their decompression applications either upon
this object, or the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor.html">kdu_region_decompressor</A> object.
</P><P>
 It should be noted, however, that some performance
benefits can be obtained by directly interfacing with
the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object or, at an even lower level, directly creating
your own 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A> and/or 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> objects, from which to pull individual image lines
&mdash; these approaches can often avoid unnecessary
copying and level shifting of image samples. Nevertheless,
there has been a lot of demand for a dead-simple, yet
also powerful interface to Kakadu, and this object
is intended to fill that requirement. In fact, the
various objects found in the "support" directory (
<A HREF="kdu$1essor.html">kdu_stripe_compressor</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$essor.html">kdu_region_decompressor</A>) are all aimed at meeting the needs of 90% of the
applications using Kakadu. That is not to say that
these objects are all that is required. You still need
to open streams of one form or another and create a
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface.
</P><P>
 In a typical decompression application based on this
object, you will need to do the following:
</P><UL><LI>
Create a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object.
</LI><LI>
Optionally use one of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> functions to adjust the portion of the original compressed
image that you want to recover &mdash; you can also
use these functions to configure the set of image components
you want decompressed and whether or not you want any
multi-component transforms to be inverted.
</LI><LI>
Initialize the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor</A> object, by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor::start</A>.
</LI><LI>
Pull image stripes from 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor::pull_stripe</A> until the image is fully decompressed (you can do
it all in one go, into a memory buffer of your choice,
if you like).
</LI><LI>
Call 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor::finish</A> (not strictly necessary).
</LI><LI>
Call 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__destroy.html">kdu_codestream::destroy</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 For a tuturial example of how to use the present object
in a typical application, consult the Kakadu demo application,
"kdu_buffered_decompress".
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that this object is built directly
on top of the services offered by 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>, so for a thorough understanding of how things work,
you might like to consult the documentation for that
object as well.
</P><P>
 Most notably, the image components manipulated by
this object are those which are described by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> machinery as output image components, as opposed to
codestream image components. For a discussion of the
differences between codestream and output image components,
see the second form of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> function. For our purposes here, however, it is sufficient
to note that output components are derived from codestream
components by applying any multi-component (or decorrelating
colour) transforms. Output components are the image
components which the content creator intends to be
rendered. Note, however, that if the component access
mode is set to 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A> instead of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A> (see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>), the codestream image components will appear to be
the output components, so no loss of flexibility is
incurred by insisting that this object processes output
components.
</P><P>
 From Kakadu version 5.1, this object offers multi-threaded
processing capabilities for enhanced throughput. These
capabilities are based upon the options for multi-threaded
processing offered by the underlying 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object and the 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> objects which it, in turn, uses. Multi-threaded processing
provides the greatest benefit on platforms with multiple
physical CPU's, or where CPU's offer hyperthreading
capabilities. Interestingly, although hyper-threading
is often reported as offering relatively little gain,
Kakadu's multi-threading model is typically able to
squeeze 30-50% speedup out of processors which offer
hyperthreading, in addition to the benefits which can
be reaped from true multi-processor (or multi-core)
architectures. Even on platforms which do not offer
either multiple CPU's or a single hyperthreading CPU,
multi-threaded processing could be beneficial, depending
on other bottlenecks which your decompressed imagery
might encounter &mdash; this is because underlying
decompression tasks can proceed while other steps might
be blocked on I/O conditions, for example.
</P><P>
 To take advantage of multi-threading, you need to
create a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object, add a suitable number of working threads to
it (see comments appearing with the definition of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>) and pass it into the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A> function. You can re-use this 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object as often as you like &mdash; that is, you need
not tear down and recreate the collaborating multi-threaded
environment between calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>. Multi-threading could not be much simpler. The only
thing you do need to remember is that all calls to
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>, 
<B>process</B> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> should be executed from the same thread &mdash; the
one identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>. This constraint represents a slight loss of flexibility
with respect to the core processing objects such as
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>, which allow calls from any thread. In exchange, however,
you get simplicity. In particular, you only need to
pass the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object into the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A> function, after which the object remembers the thread
reference for you.
