Use this function to create an instance of the internal
processing machinery, for compressing data for the
supplied open 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#tile">tile</A> interface. Until you call this function (or copy nother
object which has been created), the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exists.html">exists</A> function will return false.
</P><P>
 Multi-component transformations performed by this
function are affected by previous 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__set$f_interest.html">kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest</A> calls. In particular, you need only supply those components
which have been marked of interest via the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> function. Those components marked as uninteresting
are ignored &mdash; you can pass them in via 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> if you like, but they will have no impact on the way
in which codestream components are generated and subjected
to spatial wavelet transformation and coding.
</P><P>
 If insufficient components are currently marked as
being of interest (i.e., too many components were excluded
in a previous call to 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__set$f_interest.html">kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest</A>), the present object might not be able to find a way
of inverting the multi-component transformation network,
so as to work back to codestream image components.
In this case, an informative error message will be
generated through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>.
</P><P>
 This function takes optional 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded processing
paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of multi-processor
platforms. To see how this works, consult the description
of these arguments below. Also, pay close attention
to the use of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> arguments with the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__destroy.html">destroy</A> functions.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#flags">flags</A> argument works together with subsequent arguments
to control internal memory allocation, flow control
and optimization policies. See below for a description
of the available flags.

<P>
Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
multi-threaded processing. After creating a cooperating
thread group by following the procedure outlined in
the description of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>, any one of the threads may be used to construct this
processing engine. Separate processing queues will
automatically be created for each image component.
</P><P>
 If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A> flag (or the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF</A> flag) is supplied, these queues will also be used
to schedule the spatial wavelet transform operations
associated with each image component as jobs to be
processed asynchronously by different threads. Regardless
multi-threaded DWT processing is requested, within
each tile-component, separate queues are created to
allow simultaneous processing of code-blocks from different
subbands.
</P><P>
 By and large, you can use this object in exactly the
same way when 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL as you would with a NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> argument. That is, the use of multi-threaded processing
can be largely transparent. However, you must remember
the following two points:
</P><UL><LI>
You must supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> function &mdash; it need not refer to the same thread
as the one used to create the object here, but it must
belong to the same thread group.
</LI><LI>
You cannot rely upon all processing being complete
until you invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A> function.
</LI></UL>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="env_queue">env_queue</A> [<A HREF ="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. When 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL, all thread queues that are created inside
this object are added as sub-queues of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>. If 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is NULL, they are added as top-level queues in the
multi-threaded queue hierarchy. The present object
creates one internal queue for each tile-component,
to which each subband adds a sub-queue managed by 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A>.
</P><P>
 One advantage of supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is that it provides you with a single hook for joining
with the completion of all the thread queues which
are created by this object and its descendants &mdash;
see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> for more on this.
</P><P>
 A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is that it allows you to manipulate the sequencing
indices that are assigned by the thread queues created
internally &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A> for more on the role played by sequencing indices
in controlling the order in which work is actually
done. In particular, if 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is initially added to the thread group with a sequencing
index of N &gt;= 0, all processing within all tile-components
of the tile associated with this object will proceed
with jobs having a sequence index of N.
</P><P>
 Finally, the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> object supplied here provides a mechanism to determine
whether or not calls to 
<B>excahnge_line</B> might potentially block. This may be achieved by supplying
an 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> object whose 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies</A> function has been overridden, or by registering a
dependency monitor (see 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__set$_monitor.html">kdu_thread_queue::set_dependency_monitor</A>) with the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>. If the number of potentially blocking dependencies
identified by either of these mechanisms is 0, calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> can be invoked at least once for each component index,
without blocking the caller. Otherwise, the caller
might be temporarily blocked while waiting for dependencies
to be satisfied by DWT analysis and/or subband encoding
operations that are still in progress. This temporary
blocking is not a huge concern, since threads actually
enter what we call a "working wait", using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition</A>, during which they will often perform other tasks.
However, working waits can adversely affect cache utilization
and often cause work to be done in a less than ideal
sequence, so that other threads might go idle while
waiting for jobs to be scheduled by a thread that is
unduly delayed in a working wait. For this reason,
advanced implementations are offered the option of
using the dependency analysis methods associated with
an 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> to schedule jobs only when it is known that they are
fully ready to proceed.

Controls the internal memory allocation, buffer management

the logical OR of any appropriate combination of the
flags listed below. For convenience, the 
<B>KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DEFAULT_FLAGS</B> value may be used as a starting point, which will

you have good reason not to include them.
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE</A>: This option requests the internal machinery to work
with 32-bit representations for all image component
samples. Otherwise, the internal machinery will determine
a suitable representation precision, making every attempt
to use lower precision processing paths, which are
faster and consume less memory, so long as this does
not unduly compromise quality.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_FAST">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_FAST</A>: This option represents the opposite extreme in precision
selection to that associated with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE</A>. In fact, if both flags are supplied, the present
one will be ignored. Otherwise, if the present flag
is supplied, the function selects the lowest possible
internal processing precision, even if this does sacrifice
some image quality.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF</A>: Same as 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A> &mdash; see below.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A>: This flag is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. It specifies that the spatial DWT operations
associated with each codestream image component should
be executed as asynchronous jobs, as opposed to synchronously
when new imagery is pushed in via the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> function. When the flag is present, the object allocates
an internal buffer which can hold (approximately) 2*
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A> lines for each codestream tile-component. In the simplest
case (double buffering), this buffer is partitioned
into two parts. More generally, though, the implementation
may partition the memory into a larger number of parts
to improve performance. At any given time, the MCT
machinery may be writing data to one part while the
DWT and block coding machinery may be supplied with
data from another part. Multi-threaded DWT processing
provides a useful mechanism for minimizing CPU idle
time, since multiple threads can be scheduled not only
to block encoding operations, but also to DWT analysis
operations. If DWT analysis is the bottleneck, it fundamentally
limits the rate at which block encoding jobs can be
made available to the multi-threaded machinery; the
only way to overcome this bottleneck, if it exists,
is to allocate multiple threads to DWT analysis via
this flag.

A non-NULL object may be passed in via this argument
to allow for region-of-interest driven encoding. Note
carefully, however, that the component indices supplied
to the 
<A HREF="kdu$image__acquire_node.html">kdu_roi_image::acquire_node</A> function correspond to codestream image components.
It is up to you to ensure that the correct geometry

This argument must be strictly positive. It is used
to size the internal buffers used to hold data that
finds its way to the individual codestream tile-components,
while it is waiting to be passed to the DWT analysis
and block coding machinery.
</P><P>
 From KDU-7.2.1 on, a value of 0 is automatically translated
to 1, while a -ve value may be supplied for this argument,
in which case the buffers will be dimensioned automatically,
taking the tile width and number of components into
account.
</P><P>
 There are two important cases to understand:
</P><UL><LI>
If the DWT processing is performed in-line, in the
same thread as that which calls 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A>, then there is only one buffer, with this number of
rows, and the buffer must be filled (or the tile-component
exhausted) before DWT processing is performed. In this
case, it is usually best to select the default value
of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A>=1 so that processing can start as early as possible
and there is less chance that the image component data
will be evicted from lower levels of the CPU cache
before it is subjected to DWT analysis. However, in
the special case where multi-threaded processing is
employed, with both 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> AND 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments to this function being non-NULL, and where
the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> or one of the super-queues in its ancestry advertises
its interest in propagated dependency information (through
an overridden 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies</A> function that returns true, for example, or an installed
dependency monitor), then there are some multi-threaded
synchronization overheads associated with the onset
and completion of the internal DWT analysis machinery
(perhaps amounting to several hundred or even a thousand
clock cycles), so in this case it may be better to
select a larger value for 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A>, especially where the line width is small.
</LI><LI>
If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF</A> flag is present, the DWT operations are performed
by jobs that may be executed on any thread within the
multi-threaded environment associated with the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#env">env</A> argument. In this case, for reasons of backward compatibility,
the total amount of memory allocated for buffering
tile-component lines is given (at least approximately)
by 2*
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A>, since this is what would be consumed if a double
buffering strategy were employed. In reality, the internal
implementation may partition this total amount of memory
into a larger number of smaller buffers so that processing
can start earlier and the memory can be used more effectively
to manage interruption of threads, or scheduling of
thread resources temporarily to other jobs.
</LI></UL><P>
 You may need to play with this parameter to optimize
processing efficiency for particular applications.
</P><P>
 You should be aware that the actual number of buffer
lines allocated internally may be smaller than that
requested. For example, the implementation may limit
the total amount of buffer memory to 256 lines.
