Supplies vertical stripes of samples for each image
component. The number of entries in each of the arrays
here is equal to the number of image components, as
returned by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$omponents.html">kdu_codestream::get_num_components</A> with its optional 
<B>want_output_comps</B> argument set to true. Each stripe spans the entire
width of its image component, which must be no larger
than the ratio between the corresponding entries in
the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#row_gaps">row_gaps</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#sample_gaps">sample_gaps</A> arrays.
</P><P>
 Each successive call to this function advances the
vertical position within each image component by the
number of lines identified within the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#stripe_heights">stripe_heights</A> array. To properly compress the image, you must eventually
advance all components to the bottom. At this point,
the present function returns false (no more lines needed
in any component) and a subsequent call to 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__finish.html">finish</A> will return true.
</P><P>
 Note that although components nominally advance from
the top to the bottom, if 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">kdu_codestream::change_appearance</A> was used to flip the appearance of the vertical dimension,
the supplied data actually advances the true underlying
image components from the bottom up to the top. This
is exactly what one should expect from the description
of 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">kdu_codestream::change_appearance</A> and requires no special processing in the implemenation
of the present object.
</P><P>
 Although considerable flexibility is offered with
regard to stripe heights, there are a number of constraints.
As a general rule, you should attempt to advance the
various image components in a proportional way, when
processing incrementally (as opposed to supplying the
entire image in a single call to this function). What
this means is that the stripe height for each component
should, ideally, be inversely proportional to its vertical
sub-sampling factor. If you do not intend to do this
for any reason, the following notes should be taken
into account:
</P><UL><LI>
If the image happens to be tiled, then you must follow
the proportional processing guideline at least to the
extent that no component should fall sufficiently far
behind the rest that the object would need to maintain
multiple open tile rows simultaneously.
</LI><LI>
If a code-stream colour transform (ICT or RCT) is being
used, you must follow the proportional processing guideline
at least to the extent that the same stripe height
must be used for the first three components (otherwise,
internal application of the colour transform would
not be possible).
</LI><LI>
Similar to colour transforms, if a Part-2 multi-component
transform is being used, you must follow the proportional
processing guidelines at least to the extent that the
same stripe height must be used for components which
are combined by the multi-component transform.
</LI><LI>
Regardless of the above constraints, the selection
of proportional stripe heights improves the reliability
of the block truncation prediction algorithm associated
with calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$max_bytes.html">kdu_codestream::set_max_bytes</A>. To understand the conditions under which that function
will be called, consult the comments appearing with
the 
<B>min_slope_threshold</B> argument in the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A> function. If prediction is disabled or 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$1threshold.html">kdu_codestream::set_min_slope_threshold</A> was called from within 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A> (e.g., because you supplied a non-zero 
<B>min_slope_threshold</B> argument), there is no need to worry about pushing
stripe heights which are proportional to the corresponding
image component heights.
</LI></UL><P>
 In addition to the constraints and guidelines mentioned
above regarding the selection of suitable stripe heights,
it is worth noting that the efficiency (computational
and memory efficiency) with which image data is compressed
depends upon how your stripe heights interact with
image tiling. If the image is untiled, you are generally
best off passing small stripes, unless your application
naturally provides larger stripe buffers. If, however,
the image is tiled, then the implementation is most
efficient if your stripes happen to be aligned on vertical
tile boundaries. To simplify the determination of suitable
stripe heights (all other things being equal), the
present object provides a convenient utility, 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__get$_heights.html">get_recommended_stripe_heights</A>, which you can call at any time. Alternatively, just
push in whatever stripes your application produces
naturally.
</P><P>
 To understand the interpretation of the sample bytes
passed to this function, consult the comments appearing
with the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#precisions">precisions</A> argument below. Other forms of the overloaded 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html">push_stripe</A> function are provided to allow for compression of
higher precision image samples.
</P><P>
 Certain internal paths involve heavily optimized data
transfer routines that may exploit the availability
of SIMD instructions. Currently, optimizations exists
at least for SSSE3-capable x86 processors, under the
following conditions:
</P><UL><LI>
Conversion to all but the 32-bit absolute integer representation
(high precision reversible processing) from buffer
organizations with a sample-gap of 1 (i.e., separate
memory blocks for each component).
</LI><LI>
Conversion to all but the 32-bit absolute integer representation
(high precision reversible processing) from sample
interleaved buffers with a sample-gap of 3 (e.g., RGB
interleaved).
</LI><LI>
Conversion to all but the 32-bit absolute integer representation
(high precision reversible processing) from sample
interleaved buffers with a sample-gap of 4 (e.g., RGBA
interleaved).
</LI></UL><P>
 If you are not exciting one of the above optimization
paths, you could find that the transfer of imagery
from your stripe buffers for compression actually becomes
the bottleneck in the overall processing pipeline,
because this part runs in a single thread, while everything
else can potentially be heavily multi-threaded. By
and large, the above optimization paths cover almost
everything that is useful.
</P><P>
 In the event that an error is generated for some reason
through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>, this function may throw an exception &mdash; assuming
the error handler passed to 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$mize_errors.html">kdu_customize_errors</A> throws exceptions. These exceptions should be of type
<B>kdu_exception</B> or possibly of type 
<B>std::bad_alloc</B>. In any case, you should be prepared to catch such
errors in a robust application. In multi-threaded applications
(where a non-NULL 
<B>env</B> argument was passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A>), you should pass any caught exception to the 
<B>env</B> object's 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">kdu_thread_entity::handle_exception</A> function. After doing this, you should still invoke
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__finish.html">finish</A>, either directly or indirectly by invoking the current
object's destructor.

Array with one entry for each image component, containing
a pointer to a buffer which holds the stripe samples
for that component. The pointers may all point into
a single common buffer managed by the application,
or they might point to separate buffers. This, together
with the information contained in the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#sample_gaps">sample_gaps</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#row_gaps">row_gaps</A> arrays allows the application to implement a wide
variety of different stripe buffering strategies. The
entries (pointers) in the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#stripe_bufs">stripe_bufs</A> array are not modified by this function.

Array with one entry for each image component, identifying
the number of lines being supplied for that component
in the present call. All entries must be non-negative.
See the extensive discussion above, on the various
constraints and guidelines which may exist regarding
stripe heights and their interaction with tiling and
sub-sampling.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="sample_gaps">sample_gaps</A> [<B>int</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">

Array containing one entry for each image component,
identifying the separation between horizontally adjacent
samples within the corresponding stripe buffer found
in the

Array containing one entry for each image component,
identifying the separation between vertically adjacent
samples within the corresponding stripe buffer found
in the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#stripe_bufs">stripe_bufs</A> array. If this argument is NULL, all component stripe
buffers are assumed to hold contiguous lines from their
respective components.

If NULL, all component precisions are deemed to be
8; otherwise, the argument points to an array with
a single precision value for each component. The precision
identifies the number of least significant bits which
are actually used in each sample. If this value is
less than 8, one or more most significant bits of each
byte will be ignored.
</P><P>
 There is no implied connection between the precision
values, P, and the bit-depth of each image component,
as provided by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprecision">Sprecision</A> attribute managed by the 
<A HREF="siz_params.html">siz_params</A> object passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">kdu_codestream::create</A>. The original image sample bit-depth may be larger
or smaller than the value of P, supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#precisions">precisions</A> argument. In any event, the most significant bit of
the P-bit integer represented by each sample byte is
aligned with the most significant bit of image sample
words which we actually compress internally. Zero padding
and discarding of excess least significant bits is
applied as required.
</P><P>
 These conventions, provide the application with tremendous
flexibility in how it chooses to represent image sample
values. Suppose, for example, that the original image
sample precision for some component is only 1 bit,
as represented by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprecision">Sprecision</A> attribute managed by the 
<A HREF="siz_params.html">siz_params</A> object (this is the bit-depth value actually recorded
in the code-stream). If the value of P provided by
the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#precisions">precisions</A> array is set to 1, the bi-level image information
is embedded in the least significant bit of each byte
supplied to this function. On the other hand, if the
value of P is 8, the bi-level image information is
embedded in the most significant bit of each byte.
</P><P>
 The sample values supplied to this function are always
unsigned, regardless of whether or not the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssigned">Ssigned</A> attribute managed by 
<A HREF="siz_params.html">siz_params</A> identifies an image component as having an originally
signed representation. In this, relatively unlikely,
event, the application is responsible for level adjusting
the original sample values, by adding 2^{P-1} to each
originally signed value.

This argument may be used to control Kakadu's incremental
code-stream flushing machinery, where applicable. If
0, no incremental flushing is attempted. Otherwise,
the function checks to see if at least this number
of lines have been pushed in for the first image component,
since the last successful call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A> (or since the call to 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A>). If so, an attempt is made to flush the code-stream
again, after first calling 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">kdu_codestream::ready_for_flush</A> to see whether a new call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A> will succeed. Incremental flushing is possible only
under a very narrow set of conditions on the packet
progression order and precinct dimensions, or where
there are multiple tiles; however, the conditions for
successful incremental flushing are much more relaxed
if the compressed data target is a structured cache
as opposed to a linear codestream (see 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__get$abilities.html">kdu_compressed_target::get_capabilities</A>). For a detailed discussion of the incremental flushing
conditions, you should carefully review the comments
provided with 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A> before trying to use this feature.
</P><P>
 In a multi-threaded processing environment (i.e.,
when the 
<B>env</B> argument passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A> was non-NULL), this argument is ignored on all but
the first call to this function. During this first
call, the argument is used to configure a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__auto_flush.html">kdu_codestream::auto_flush</A> so that incremental flushing can proceed in the background,
at the most appropriate points.
</P><P>
 It is possible for you do organize incremental flushing
all by yourself, passing 0 for the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#flush_period">flush_period</A> argument and invoking 
<B>flush</B> or 
<B>auto_flush</B> yourself, with appropriate parameters.
</P><P>
 In any event, it is recommended that you do not attempt
to change the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html#flush_period">flush_period</A> argument between successive calls to this function,
even if you think you have some clever way of doing
so.
