Manages the information associated with a JPEG2000
<B>SIZ</B> marker segment. There is only one of these per image
&mdash; i.e., tile-specific and component-specific
forms of this parameter class (cluster type) are both
disallowed.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "SIZ", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#SIZ_params">SIZ_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 This object also manages the information associated
with a JPEG2000 
<B>CBD</B> (Component Bit-Depth) marker segment, if any. There
is at most one of these per image, which must appear
in the main header. The CBD marker segment is written
if and only if the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sextensions_MCT">Sextensions_MCT</A> flag is present in the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sextensions">Sextensions</A> attribute managed by 
<A HREF="siz_params.html">siz_params</A>. The 
<B>CBD</B> marker segment is central to JPEG2000 Part-2 multi-component
transforms.
</P><P>
 This object also manages the information associated
with a JPEG2000 
<B>CAP</B> (Capabilities) marker segment, if any. There is at
most one of these per image, which must appear in the
main header. The CAP marker segment is written if 
<A HREF="globals.html#SCpart2_caps">SCpart2_caps</A> is non-zero; moreover, if the capability associated
with 
<A HREF="globals.html#SCpart2_caps">SCpart2_caps</A> is one that cannot be ignored by a decoder that does
not understand the associated ammendment capability,
the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scap">Scap</A> boolean attribute is set to true when writing the
SIZ marker segment. During codestream parsing, the
<A HREF="globals.html#Scap">Scap</A> attribute determines what happens if a 
<B>CAP</B> marker segment is encountered that defines unrecognized
capabilities. If this happens and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scap">Scap</A> is true, a warning message is generated; otherwise,
the unrecognized capabilities are silently ignored.
</P><P>
 The following attributes are defined. For an explanation
of pattern strings, consult the comments appearing

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile">Sprofile</A>; Pattern = "(PROFILE0=0,PROFILE1=1,PROFILE2=2,PART2=3,
CINEMA2K=4,CINEMA4K=5,BROADCAST=6)" &mdash; Restricted
profile to which the code-stream conforms. The value
must currently be an integer in the range 0 to 6. Profile0
is the most restrictive profile for Part 1 conforming
codestreams. Profile2 places no restrictions on the
code-stream other than those restrictions imposed by
ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG2000, Part 1). A value of 3 means
that the codestream requires support for one or more
features defined in ISO/IEC 15444-2 (JPEG2000, Part
2) &mdash; additional information about these extensions
is identified via the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sextensions">Sextensions</A> parameter attribute. The values 4 and 5 correspond
to new profile restrictions for Digital Cinema, while
6 identifies profile restrictions for broadcast applications.
Even though these have higher numerical values than
Part 2 codestreams, this is only for the purpose of
backward compatibility with earlier versions of Kakadu.
The 2K and 4K digital cinema profiles and the broadcast
profiles are closely relatred and very restrictive
subsets ofJPEG2000 Part 1, defined by various ammendments
to the original standard. If the system determines
that support for Part 2 features is required, the profile
will be set automatically to 3. Also, if the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast">Sbroadcast</A> attribute is present, the profile is set automatically
to 6. Otherwise, the profile is not adjusted by Kakadu's
codestream creation machinery. However, if the profile
is found to be insufficient, the system will generate
a warning at the point where it first encounters an
inconsistency; this might not occur until near the
end of the processing in certain rare circumstances.
The system does perform some extensive checks for compliance
with the Digital Cinema profiles when they are used,
but only during codestream generation. It makes every
effort to set default values in such a way as to ensure
comliance with Digital Cinema profiles, where they
are used, but it is ultimately up to the user to supply
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> (and possibly 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cagglengths">Cagglengths</A>) attributes so as to ensure that compressed data sizes
match the application-dependent constraints specified
by the Digital Cinema profile specifications. Similar
considerations apply to the broadcast profile, except
that it depends on additional information provided
via the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast">Sbroadcast</A> parameter attribute (similar to the connection between
the Part 2 profile and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sextensions">Sextensions</A>). The default value for the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile">Sprofile</A> attribute is Profile2. When setting the profile, you
may find it convenient to use the macro's 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile_PROFILE0">Sprofile_PROFILE0</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile_PROFILE1">Sprofile_PROFILE1</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile_PROFILE2">Sprofile_PROFILE2</A>,

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast">Sbroadcast</A>; Pattern = "I(single=0,multi=1)(irrev=0,rev=1)" &mdash;
This parameter attribute provides more specific details
for the BROADCAST profile (
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile">Sprofile</A>=6). Its 3 fields have the following interpretation.
The first field identifies the broadcast profile level,
which is currently required to lie in the range 1 through
7. The profile level is concerned with the bit-rate
and sampling rate of a compressed video stream, as
described in an amendment to IS15444-1. The system
does not explicitly impose these constraints, since
they depend upon the intended frame rate &mdash; this
can readily be done at the application level. The second
field indicates whether the single-tile (0) or multi-tile
(1) variation of the profile is specified; the multi-tile
variation allows for either 1 or 4 tiles per image,
where multiple tiles must be identical in size and
involve either vertical tiles or 2 tiles in each direction.
When working with the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__set__1.html">kdu_params::set</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html">kdu_params::get</A> functions, use the macros 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast_single">Sbroadcast_single</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast_multi">Sbroadcast_multi</A> for this field's values. The third field indicates
whether the irreversible or reversible transform variation
of the profile is specified. When working with the
<B>kdu_parms::set</B> and 
<A HREF="kdu_params__get__1.html">kdu_params::get</A> functions, use the macros 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast_irrev">Sbroadcast_irrev</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast_rev">Sbroadcast_rev</A> for this field's values. During codestream generation,
this parameter attribute will default to the single-tile,
irreversible level 1 variant if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile">Sprofile</A> identifies the BROADCAST profile. Also, if 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sbroadcast">Sbroadcast</A> is specified and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile">Sprofile</A> is left unspecified, the system will automatically
set 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprofile">Sprofile</A> to 6 &mdash; BROADCAST.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scap">Scap</A>; Pattern = "B" &mdash; Flag indicating whether or
not capabilities defined in ammendments to the standards,
as recorded in the 
<B>CAP</B> marker segment, must be recognized for correct decoding
to occur. Currently, the only recognized capabilities
from ammendments are managed by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#SCpart2_caps">SCpart2_caps</A> attribute.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#SCpart2_caps">SCpart2_caps</A>; Pattern = "[EXTENDED_COD=32768]" &mdash; Identifies
capability extensions that are found in ammendments
to Part-2 of the JPEG2000 family of standards. Currently,
only one such capability, 
<A HREF="globals.html#SCpart2_caps_EXTENDED_COD">SCpart2_caps_EXTENDED_COD</A>, is defined, corresponding to the possible presence
of block-coder extensions in COD/COC marker segments.
This capability was introduced with IS15444-2/AMD4.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssize">Ssize</A>; Pattern = "II" &mdash; Canvas dimensions: vertical
dimension first. For compressors, this will normally
be derived from the dimensions of the individual image
components. Explicitly supplying the canvas dimensions
may desirable if the source image files do not indicate
their dimensions, or if custom sub-sampling factors
are desired.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sorigin">Sorigin</A>; Pattern = "II" &mdash; Image origin on canvas: vertical
coordinate first. Defaults to {0,0}, or the tile origin
if one is given.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scomponents">Scomponents</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Number of codestream image
components. For compressors, this will normally be
deduced from the number and type of image files supplied
to the compressor. Note carefully, however, that if
a multi-component transform is used, the number of
codestream image components might not be equal to the
number of "output image components" given by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A>. In this case, the value of 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> and the corresponding 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mprecision">Mprecision</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Msigned">Msigned</A> attributes should generally be associated with the
image files being read (for compression) or written
(for decompression).
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssigned">Ssigned</A>; Pattern = "B", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Indicates whether each codestream image component contains
signed or unsigned sample values. For compressors,
this will normally be deduced from the image files
supplied to the compressor, but may be explicitly set
if raw input files are to be used. Also, if you happen
to be using the Part-2 multi-component transform capabilities,
the signed/unsigned attributes of the original image
components should be expressed by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Msigned">Msigned</A>; in this case, you might want to explicitly set 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssigned">Ssigned</A> in a manner which reflects the signed/unsigned characteristics
of the codestream image components produced after subjecting
the original components to the forward multi-component
transform. Note that the last supplied identifier is
repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprecision">Sprecision</A>; Pattern = "I", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Indicates the bit-depth of each codestream image component.
For compressors, this will normally be deduced from
the image files supplied to the compressor, but may
need to be explicitly set if raw input files are to
be used. Also, if you happen to be using the Part-2
multi-component transform capabilities, the precision
of the original image components should be expressed
by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mprecision">Mprecision</A>; in this case, you might want to explicitly set 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprecision">Sprecision</A> to reflect the bit-depth of the codestream image components
produced after subjecting the original components to
the forward multi-component transform. Note that the
last supplied value is repeated indefinitely for all
remaining components.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssampling">Ssampling</A>; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Indicates the sub-sampling factors for each codestream
image component. In each record, the vertical factor
appears first, followed by the horizontal sub-sampling
factor. The last supplied record is repeated indefinitely
for all remaining components. For compressors, a suitable
set of sub-sampling factors will normally be deduced
from the individual image component dimensions, expressed
via 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sdims">Sdims</A>.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sdims">Sdims</A>; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Indicates the dimensions (vertical, then horizontal)
of each individual codestream image component. The
last supplied record is repeated indefinitely for all
remaining components. For compressors, the image component
dimensions will normally be deduced from the image
files supplied to the compressor, but may be explicitly
set if raw input files are to be used.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A>; Pattern = "I" &mdash; Number of image components
produced at the output of the inverse multi-component
transform &mdash; during compression, you may think
of these as original image components. In any event,
we refer to them as "MCT output components", taking
the perspective of the decompressor. The value of 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> may be smaller than or larger than the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scomponents">Scomponents</A> value, which refers to the number of "codestream image
components". During decompression, the codestream image
components are supplied to the input of the inverse
multi-component transform. Note carefully, however,
that for Kakadu to perform a forward multi-component
transform on image data supplied to a compressor, the
value of 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> must be at least as large as 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scomponents">Scomponents</A> and the inverse multi-component transform must provide
sufficient invertible transform blocks to derive the
codestream components from the output image components.
In the special case where 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> is 0, or not specified, there is no multi-component
transform. In this case, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Scomponents">Scomponents</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssigned">Ssigned</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sprecision">Sprecision</A> define the output image components.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Msigned">Msigned</A>; Pattern = "B", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Indicates whether each MCT output component (see 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> for a definition of "MCT output components") contains
signed or unsigned sample values. If fewer than 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> values are provided, the last supplied value is repeated
as required for all remaining components. Compressors
should be able to deduce this information from the
image files supplied, in which case the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ssigned">Ssigned</A> attribute might have to be set explicitly to reflect
the impact of forward multi-component transformation
on the source data (the source data are the "MCT output
components" during compression).
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mprecision">Mprecision</A>; Pattern = "I", [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] &mdash;
Indicates the bit-depth of each MCT output component
(see 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> for a definition of "MCT output components"). If fewer
than 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mcomponents">Mcomponents</A> values are provided, the last supplied value is repeated
as required for all remaining components. Compressors
might be able to deduce this information from the image
files supplied, in which case the

</LI></UL><P>
 Although the JPEG2000 
<B>SIZ</B> marker cannot represent negative coordinates, it is
particularly convenient to allow this object to store
and report negative coordinates. These should not trouble
applications which interface with it, since all of
the algebraic properties of the coordinate system still
hold. Negative coordinates will be converted into appropriate
non-negative coordinates only when a valid marker segment
must be written out &mdash; to do this the 
<B>write_marker_segment</B> function must examine various 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> attributes from every tile-component in the image
to determine appropriate offsets to the negative coordinates
which will not alter the interpretation of the canvas
coordinate system.
</P><P>
 For the above reason, you should avoid writing a 
<B>SIZ</B> marker segment (calling 
<A HREF="kdu_params__gen$segments.html">kdu_params::generate_marker_segments</A>) until all code-stream parameters have been finalized
for all tiles and tile-components.
