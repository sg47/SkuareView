<P>
Use this function to gracefully close request queues
and the associated communication channels (once all
request queues using the communication channel have
disconnected). Unlike 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A>, this function also leaves the object open for reading
data from the cache.
</P><P>
 This function may safely be called at any time. If
the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A> function has not been called since the last call to
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A>, this function leaves 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_active.html">is_active</A> returning true, but will eventually cause 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> to return false when invoked with the same 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#queue_id">queue_id</A>.
</P><P>
 After this function has been called, you will not
be able to post any more window changes to the request
queue via 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A>, even though the request queue may remain alive for
some time (if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#wait_for_completion">wait_for_completion</A> is false), in the sense that 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> does not immediately return false.
</P><P>
 The function actually causes a pre-emptive request
to be posted as the last request in the queue, which
involves an empty window of interest, to encourage
the queue to become idle as soon as possible. The function
then notifies the thread management function that the
request queue should be closed once it becomes idle,
unless the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#timeout_milliseconds">timeout_milliseconds</A> period expires first.

<P>
This argument does not necessarily have an immediate
effect. Its purpose is to try to keep a TCP channel
open beyond the point at which all request channels
have disconnected, so that the channel can be re-used
in a later call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A>. This can be useful in automated applications, which
need to establish multiple connections in sequence
with minimal overhead.
</P><P>
 If this argument is true, the function puts the underlying
primary communication channel for the identified request
queue (or any request queue if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> is -1) in the "keep-alive" state, unless there is
another primary channel already in the "keep-alive"
state. In practice, the primary channel will not be
kept alive if it is closed by the server, or if an
error occurs on some request channel which is using
it.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#keep_transport_open">keep_transport_open</A> is false, the function cancels the "keep-alive" status
of any primary TCP channel, not just the one associated
with an identified request queue, closing that channel
if it is no longer in use. The function may be used
in this way to kill a channel that was being kept alive,
even after all request queues have disconnected and,
indeed, even after a call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A>.

<P>
Specifies the maximum amount of time the network management
thread should wait for the request queue to become
idle before closing it down. If this time limit expires,
the forced closure of the request queue will also cause
forced shutdown of the relevant underlying communication
channels and any other request queues which may be
using them.
</P><P>
 If you have multiple request queues open and they
happen to be sharing a common primary HTTP request
channel (e.g., because the server was unwilling to
assign multiple JPIP channels), you should be aware
that forced termination of the request queue due to
a timeout will generally cause the primary channel
to be shut down. This means that your other request
queues will also be disconnected. To avoid this, you
are recommended to specify a timeout which is quite
long, unless you are in the process of closing all
request queues associated with the client.
</P><P>
 You can always reduce the timeout by calling this
function again.

One of the request queue identifiers returned by a
previous call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>, or else a negative integer, in which case all request
queues will be disconnected with the same parameters.
If the indicated queue identifier was never issued
by a call to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> or was previously disconnected, the function does
nothing except potentially remove the "keep-alive"
state of a primary TCP channel, as discussed in the
description of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#keep_transport_open">keep_transport_open</A> argument &mdash; this may cause a previously saved
TCP transport channel to be closed.

<P>
If true, the function blocks the caller until the request
queue ceases to be alive. As explained above, this
means that the request queue must become idle, or the
specified timeout must expire. If false, the function
returns immediately, so that subsequent calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> may return true for some time.
</P><P>
 If you need to specify a long timeout, for the reasons
outlined above under 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html#timeout_milliseconds">timeout_milliseconds</A>, it is usually best not to wait. Waiting usually makes
more sense when closing all request queues associated
with the client, in which case a short timeout should
do no harm.
