This object represents the state of a running thread.
Threads generally belong to groups of cooperating workers.
Each such group has an owner, whose 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> object was directly created using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__create.html">create</A>. The other working threads are all created using the
owner's 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A> member. When the owner is destroyed, the entire group
is destroyed along with it &mdash; after waiting for
all workers to go idle. When one thread in a group
generates an error through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>, resulting in a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A>, the remaining threads in the group will also throw
exceptions when they next invoke any (or almost any)
of the threading API functions defined here. This helps
ensure that the group behaves as a single working entity.
In each case, exception catching and rethrowing is
restricted to exceptions of type 
<B>kdu_exception</B>.
</P><P>
 All Kakadu's multi-threading support is designed to
work correctly even if the group owner is the only
thread in its group &mdash; in that case, the group
owner generally gets shunted around to do the various
scheduled jobs and support for physical multi-threading
support is not required (for example, everything should
work even if Kakadu is compiled with 
<B>KDU_NO_THREADS</B> defined).
</P><P>
 This object is designed to be sub-classed. When you
do so, your derived object will be used by every thread
within the same working group. This is achieved by
correctly implementing the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__new_instance.html">new_instance</A> function in your derived class.
</P><P>
 Kakadu version 7 involves a completely new multi-threading
system to that found in earlier versions. The two most
important differences are: a) the new system involves
distributed scheduling of jobs so that threads can
continue working without ever entering a shared critical
section; b) the new system provides a generic mechanism
for keeping track of dependencies so that jobs need
not be scheduled for execution until they are free
to run uninhibited. This prevents a lot of the needless
blocking on shared resources that occurred in earlier
versions of Kakadu. There are plenty of other differences:
for example, mutex locks and distributed memory management
are now partitioned by codestream, where appropriate,
so there are no efficiency losses incurred by using
a single thread group to process multiple codestreams.
</P><P>
 In order to support all these changes, the notion
of a 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> has changed radically, being only superficially similar
to its namesake in previous versions. Moreover, the
abstract base class 
<B>kdu_worker</B> has been replaced by a related yet quite different
base class 
<A HREF="kdu$d_job.html">kdu_thread_job</A>. These are explained briefly below.
</P><P>
 As in previous versions of Kakadu, thread queues are
organized into a hierarchy. New queues may be created
as top-level queues or else as sub-queues of other
queues. Each queue still has the notion of "completion"
and it is possible to wait for completion of a queue,
together with all of its sub-queues. There is no longer
any such thing as a synchronized job, however. Instead,
applications generally derive from the 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> base class to implement and schedule jobs directly
from within the derived implementation. To facilitate
this, a special 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies</A> function is provided, which allows jobs within other
queues (even other domains) to notify a 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> object of the availability or removal of dependencies
that may affect the runnability of jobs that it may
choose to schedule. This is a more flexible and powerful
feature than the synchronized job of before.
</P><P>
 One important concept that was not present in previous
versions of Kakadu is the "work domain", or simply
"domain". All thread queues must be assigned to domains
when they are added to a thread group using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A>. There is a default domain (one whose domain name
is a NULL or empty string), but the only thread queues
that can be assigned to the default domain are those
that schedule no jobs. When jobs are scheduled, they
are appended to the domain to which their queues belong.
Within a domain, jobs are launched in the same order
that they are scheduled &mdash; although of course,
this statement cannot be taken too strictly because
scheduling and launching of jobs are all performed
by asynchronous threads, so delays incurred mid-way
through a scheduling or launching step might alter
the apparent order. Typically, all threads in a thread
group belong to the default domain, which means that
they have no preference for where they do work; these
threads service domains in a round-robin fashion so
long as work remains to be done. It is also possible
to assign threads to a particular work domain when
they are added via the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_thread</A> function. This does not prevent them from doing work
in another domain, but it does mean that they will
preferentially pull jobs from their assigned domain.
</P><P>
 Another important concept, not present in previous
versions of Kakadu, is "background domains". Background
domains are similar to other work domains, except that
their jobs are either not urgent or may be subject
to unbounded delays (e.g., I/O operations). Background
jobs are normally scheduled well ahead of the point
when they are needed. Whenever a thread is waiting
for a condition that has not yet arrived, it processes
any jobs that are available to run, so as to avoid
yielding its executable context &mdash; that can be
expensive. The main reason for creating a special category
for background jobs is to indicate that they should
not be performed by these waiting threads &mdash; the
only exception is when all threads are waiting for
some condition to occur, in which case any waiting
thread may perform outstanding background jobs. Background
jobs are used to pre-parse codestream content during
decompression and to flush codestream content during
compression. However, they may have other uses. Background
domains are identified as such when a background thread
queue which can schedule jobs is first attached to
the domain. This happens if 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A> is passed the special 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_BACKGROUND">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_BACKGROUND</A> flag along with a queue whose 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__get$max_jobs.html">kdu_thread_queue::get_max_jobs</A> function returns non-zero.
