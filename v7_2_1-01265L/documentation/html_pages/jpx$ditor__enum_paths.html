Use this function to walk through all the "paths" which
are associated with the current configuration, discovering
the participating regions as you go. To use this function,
you must first understand how paths are defined. Before
we do this, however, we point out that the function
retrieves an entire collection of connected regions
in one go, returning their inidices via the 255-element
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_members">path_members</A> array and setting a single bit flag in the 8-element
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_flags">path_flags</A> array for each region which is found to belong to
the path. When calling this function for the first
time, all 8 members of the 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_flags">path_flags</A> array must be equal to 0. To enumerate subsequent
paths, the function may be called again, passing in
the same 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_flags">path_flags</A> values (without re-initializing it). The function
uses this information to discover the first path which
has not yet been enumerated, if any.
</P><P>
 A "path" is formed by quadrilateral regions with simple
connectivity, as explained below. Paths can be understood
as the skeletal representation of this connectivity,
around which the region boundaries can be expanded
or contracted using the powerful 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html">set_path_thickness</A> function. Path junctions can be formed using ellipses
or by simple sharing of edges between quadrilateral
regions. Paths provide a natural formalism for many
interactive shape editing operations, but they also
provide a means for calculating geometric properties
of regions of interest.
</P><P>
 We begin by pointing out that a path is composed of
a collection of connected path segments, each of which
is the line segment which joins the mid-points of opposing
edges of some quadrilateral. The quadrilateral in question
is called a "path brick" and all path bricks are members
of the path. Ellipses do not themselves contribute
path segments, but their presence may contribute to
the determination of which quadrilateral edges are
used to define path segments. Moreover, ellipses which
are centered at the end-points of any path segment
are considered to be members of the path.
</P><P>
 Intuitively, a path brick is a long, thin region,
which contributes a single "path segment" that runs
down the middle between the mid-points of its opposite
edges. Formally, we define a path brick and its associated
path segment as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
A quadrilateral is said to have a "compatible edge"
if: (a) the edge has identical end-points to an edge
in exactly one other quadrilateral; or (b) the mid-point
of the edge is the centre of some ellipse (the geometry
of the ellipse is irrelevant); or (c) the end-points
of the edge are identical (i.e., the edge is a single
point). Any or all of these three conditions may hold.
Thus, for example, a compatible edge might be shared
by two or more other quadrilaterals so long as its
mid-point coincides with the centre of an ellipse.
</LI><LI>
A "triangle" is a quadrilateral region which has only
three distinct vertices.
</LI><LI>
A "singularity" is a quadrilateral region, in which
all vertices coincide.
</LI><LI>
A quadrilateral is said to have a "multiply shared
edge" if that edge has identical end-points to an edge
in two or more other quadrilaterals and it does not
satisfy the conditions for being a "compatible edge".
</LI><LI>
A quadrilateral region is a "potential path brick"
if it is not a triangle, not a singularity, has no
multiply shared edges and it has one of the following:
(a) no compatible edges; (b) 1 compatible edge; or
(c) 2 opposing compatible edges (i.e., compatible edges
with no common vertex). In case (b), the region's path
segment runs between the mid-point of the compatible
edge and the mid-point of the opposing edge. In case
(c), the region's path segment runs between the mid-points
of the two compatible edges. In case (a), the region's
path segment runs between the two opposing edges which
are furthest apart.
</LI><LI>
A quadrilateral region which is a potential path brick
is said to be an actual "path brick" only if its path
segment has non-zero length and is fully contained
within the quadrilateral region. Only true path bricks
actually contribute path segments.
</LI></UL><P>
 In the event that a path contains junctions &mdash;
i.e., where a path segment shares its end-point with
more than one other path segment &mdash; the function
considers each branch from the junction to be a separate
path. The function essentially finds a novel path brick
and then builds out from it until it comes back to
itself (a loop) or encounters a junction. One implication
of this is that the function can only return a complete
closed path if it has no junctions. This is deliberate,
because junctions make it possible otherwise to interpret
closed paths in many different ways. If you wish to
discover closed paths with junctions you can assemble
the results produced by multiple invocations of this
function and analyze their 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_start">path_start</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_end">path_end</A> coordinates.

Returns the number of regions which participate in
the path. If this is 0, there are no more paths. Otherwise,
the return value corresponds to the number of entries
of 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_members">path_members</A> which have been set by this function.

<P>
An array with at least 8 elements, whose entries together
provide 256 bit flags, which correspond to individual
regions that may belong to current or previous paths.
On entry, if a flag is set, the corresponding region
is a member of a previously enumerated path. On exit,
flags corresponding to members of the current path
are also set.

<H4><A NAME="path_members">path_members[]</A> [<B>kdu_byte</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
An array containing at least 255 entries (to be sure
there will be no overwriting). The function writes
the indices of each region which participates in the
path into this array, where the number of such regions
is the function's return value. Note that the path
members are written to this array in sequence, so that
consecutive members are connected via path segments.
Path members include both path bricks and ellipses
whose centres lie on one of the end-points of a path
segment. Where ellipses are included in the returned
path members, they are considered as zero length path
segments whose end-points lie at the centre of the
ellipse, for the purpose of establishing a return sequence.
</P><P>
 Region indices have the same interpretation as in
the 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__get$selection.html">get_selection</A>,

<A HREF="jpx$ditor__mod$fy_region.html">modify_region</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__get$or_region.html">get_path_segment_for_region</A> functions.
</P><P>
 The path members returned by each successive invocation
of this function (assuming you do not re-initialize
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html#path_flags">path_flags</A> in between) are guaranteed to be disjoint.
