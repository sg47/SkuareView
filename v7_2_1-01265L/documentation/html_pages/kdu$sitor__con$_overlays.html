Use this function to enable or disable the rendering
of spatially sensitive metadata as overlay information
on the compositing surface. When enabled, overlay information
is generated as required during calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__process.html">process</A> and folded into the composited result. If overlay
surfaces were previously active, disabling the overlay
functionality may cause the next call to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__process.html">process</A> to return a 
<B>new_region</B> which is the size of the entire composited image,
so that your application will know that it needs to
repaint the whole thing.
</P><P>
 Overlays are available only when working with JPX
data sources.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency_effect">dependency_effect</A> arguments allow you to restrict overlay information
to just those regions of interest which are related
(or not related) to one or more specific entities in
the metadata hierarchy. See below for a detailed description
of how such relationships are evaluated and how 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> metanodes supplied to this function is used to build
up internal dependency expressions.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#blending_factor">blending_factor</A> argument allows you to control the visibility of overlays
in a manner which does not require the overlay content
to be regenerated, facilitating the efficient implementation
of some very useful visual effects.
</P><P>
 Most of the parameters passed in here are passed along
to the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__cus$t_overlay.html">custom_paint_overlay</A> function, which may be overridden to provide custom
painting of overlays. By default, however, that function
does nothing and the internal 
<B>paint_overlay</B> function is invoked, receiving the same parameters.
Their interpretation is discussed below.

Specifies the minimum size occupied by the overlay's
bounding box on the composited surface, at the prevailing
scale. If an overlay has a bounding box which will
be rendered with both dimensions smaller than 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#min_display_size">min_display_size</A>, it will not be rendered at all. Setting a modest
value for this parameter, say in the range 4 to 8,
helps reduce clutter when viewing an image with a lot
of metadata. On the other hand, this can make it hard
to locate tiny regions of significance when zoomed
out to a small scale. This parameter is handled outside
of 
<B>paint_overlay</B> and 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__cus$t_overlay.html">custom_paint_overlay</A> &mdash; if you change it, the internal machinery may
determine that some regions of the composited image
surface need to be regenerated.

This argument is used to scale the alpha channel of
any overlay buffer before blending the overlay with
the underlying imagery. Any blending factor may be
used, including factors which are much larger than
1, since the alpha values are clipped after scaling.
One implication of this is that large blending factors
can render barely visible portions of a painted overlay
in stark relief. The multiplication itself is performed
on-the-fly during composition, without actually affecting
the overlay buffer contents. This means that you can
modulate the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#blending_factor">blending_factor</A> without having to regenerate any metadata overlay
content. After changing this parameter, subsequent
calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__process.html">process</A> will generally recompose all regions in which metadata
overlay content exists.
</P><P>
 Negative blending factors are also permitted and can
prove very useful. If the blending factor is negative,
alpha values are multiplied by the absolute value of
the blending factor and clipped (as above), but the
colour channels of the overlay pixels are inverted.
For 32-bit/pixel buffer representations, this means
that red R becomes 255-R, green G becomes 255-G and
blue B becomes 255-B. For higher precision buffer organizations,
the principle is applied in the most natural way (so,
for floating point colour channels in the range 0 to
1, red R becomes 1-R, green G becomes 1-G and blue
B becomes 1-B, etc.). All of this is done on-the-fly
during rendering.
</P><P>
 By supplying 0 for this parameter, you can temporarily
turn off overlays, while retaining the overlay buffers
and metadata content. This ensures that overlays can
be quickly and efficiently retrieved in the future,
while also ensuring that the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__sea$_overlays.html">search_overlays</A> function returns the same results that it would if
overlay information were being painted.
</P><P>
 Note that this parameter is not actually passed along
to the 
<B>paint_overlay</B> and 
<B>custom_paint_overlays</B> function, since its effect is handled through the
way in which painted overlay content is blended onto
the composited image surface.

This parameter determines the maximum extent by which
overlay information may be painted beyond the region
occupied by a JPX region of interest node. The painting
border is measured in pixels on the compositing reference
grid and extends in all directions away from the ROI
node to be painted. The parameter is passed to 
<B>paint_overlay</B> and 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__cus$t_overlay.html">custom_paint_overlay</A> via a 
<A HREF="kdu$arams.html">kdu_overlay_params</A> object, but there is no obligation for the overlay
painting implementation to actually use a border of
this size &mdash; so long as this border size is not
exceeded. The 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#max_painting_border">max_painting_border</A> is actually used to determine the region which may
be affected by the painting of overlay information
for a region of interest, so that the painting procedure
can be invoked correctly.
</P><P>
 Each time you call this function with a different
value for the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#max_painting_border">max_painting_border</A> argument, all active metadata is discarded and must
be rediscovered (and repainted) from scratch. This
can potentially be a costly exercise, so if you want
to implement a scheme which modulates the border size
associated with overlay content, it would be more efficient
to leave the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#max_painting_border">max_painting_border</A> fixed and instead use the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#aux_params">aux_params</A> to modulate the actual border size, within the bounds
established by 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#max_painting_border">max_painting_border</A>.

This argument is used in conjunction with 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency_effect">dependency_effect</A> to build up a sum-of-products expression which is
tested to determine which regions of interest should
be revealed within the metadata overlay. Each term
in the sum-of-products expression involves a test between
the region of interest (ROI) in question and a single
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> metanode. The test is performed by invoking the powerful
<A HREF="jpx$anode__find_path_to.html">jpx_metanode::find_path_to</A> function to see if a path can be found from the ROI
description metanode to the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> metanode. The 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__find_path_to.html">jpx_metanode::find_path_to</A> function is configured to examine paths whose initial
descending component includes descendants and "reverse
alternate parent links", whose final ascending component
includes parents and "reverse alternate child links",
and whose path nodes may not belong to any other region
of interest. In this way, the paths which are examined
are those which can make the ROI visible to the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> metanode by following descendants and alternate child
links downwards and parent or alternate parent links
upwards. This is a semantically meaningful way to identify
an ROI as being of interest to the 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> node, while excluding paths which pass through other
(inherently more relevant) regions of interest.

This argument is used to cancel and/or build up a sum-of-products
expression which is evaluated for each candidate region
of interest to determine whether or not it should be
rendered to the overlay plane. The possible values
are as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
0 erases the internal sum-of-products expression if
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> is an empty interface; otherwise creates a new sum-of-products
expression consisting of the single condition "Is Related
to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A>".
</LI><LI>
1 adds a new "OR" term to the sum-of-products expression
being constructed internally, with the condition "Is
Related to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A>". Does nothing if 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> is an empty interface.
</LI><LI>
-1 adds a new "OR" term to the sum-of-products expression
being constructed internally, with the condition "Is
Not Related to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A>". Does nothing if 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> is an empty interface.
</LI><LI>
2 adds the condition "And Is Related to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A>" to the most recent term in the sum-of-products expression
being constructed internally. Does nothing if 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> is an empty interface.
</LI><LI>
-2 adds the condition "And Is Not Related to 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A>" to the most recent term in the sum-of-products expression
being constructed internally. Does nothing if 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#dependency">dependency</A> is an empty interface.
</LI><LI>
All other values cause the internal sum-of-products
expression to be left unchanged.

 For example, the expression "(Is related to A and

Array with 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#num_aux_params">num_aux_params</A> integer parameters which are passed along to the 
<B>paint_overlay</B> and 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__cus$t_overlay.html">custom_paint_overlay</A> functions via an 
<A HREF="kdu$arams.html">kdu_overlay_params</A> object.
</P><P>
 The internal implementation of the 
<B>paint_overlay</B> function interprets any supplied auxiliary parameters
as follows (note that this interpretation extends but
remains backward compatible with earlier interpretations):
</P><UL><LI>
The parameters are organized into M segments (or "rows"),
denoted m=1,2,...,M.
</LI><LI>
Each row m specifies a border size Bm, a sequence of
colours denoted ARGB_m0, ARGB_m1, ..., ARGB_mBm, and
a threshold Tm.
</LI><LI>
If the collection of regions defined by the ROI description
box which is being painted have an average "width"
which is greater than or equal to T1, the border size
and colours associated with row 1 are used to paint
the entire ROI. Otherwise, if the average ROI "width"
is greater than or equal to T2, the border size and
colours associated with row 2 are used; and so forth.
</LI><LI>
The average ROI "width" is assessed by applying the
<A HREF="jpx_roi__measure_span.html">jpx_roi::measure_span</A> function to each region provided by the ROI description
box and forming a weighted average of the returned
widths, weighted according to the corresponding lengths
&mdash; note that 
<A HREF="jpx_roi__measure_span.html">jpx_roi::measure_span</A> returns results which are completely invariant to
arbitrary orientations. Note also that the widths and
lengths are assessed after transforming the region
coordinates according to the current rendering scale
and geometry.
</LI><LI>
ARGB colour values have their alpha (blending) value
in the most significant byte, followed by red, green
and then blue in the least significant byte. When painting
overlays for higher precision renditions (e.g., with
floating-point buffers) the relevant colour and alpha
components are scaled in the most natural manner.
</LI><LI>
If any row m specifies a border size of Bm=0, no further
rows are considered and there is no threshold value
Tm, so the only parameter following Bm is the interior
colour ARGB_0.
</LI><LI>
For all other rows m, ARGB_m0 denotes the colour to
be used for painting the interior of the region of
interest; ARGB_m1 denotes the colour used for painting
the inner-most border pixels; and so forth out to ARGB_mBm
which is used for painting the outer-most border pixels.
</LI><LI>
If any 
<A HREF="kdu$sitor__con$_overlays.html#num_aux_params">num_aux_params</A> is such that the available set of parameters terminates
part way through row m, the following policy is applied
to automatically complete the row. If the border size
is missing, it defaults to Bm=1 (for m&gt;1) or Bm=
<B>get_max_painting_border</B> (for m=1). If the interior colour is missing, it defaults
to ARGB_m0=0 (totally transparent). If the interior
border colour is missing, it default to ARGB_m1=0xFF0000FF
(solid blue). If any subsequent border colours ARGB_mb
are missing (1 &lt; b &lt;= Bm), the default border
colour is obtained by replicating the last available
border colour but decreasing the alpha component linearly
towards 0 with b. If the threshold Tm is missing, it
is taken to be 0 (this threshold is satisfied by all
possible values of ROI "width").
</LI></UL><P>
 Each time you call this function with a different
set of auxiliary overlay parameters, all active metadata
is scheduled for repainting with the new parameters.
