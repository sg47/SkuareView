Use this function to specify the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#window">window</A> of interest for a given window context (as given by
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#context_id">context_id</A>), along with any cache model manipulation instructions,
which may be accompany the window.
</P><P>
 Like most functions offered by the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A> object, the call affects only one specific window
context, as identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#context_id">context_id</A>. Each time this function is invoked with a 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#context_id">context_id</A> which differs from any of those currently in use,
a new window context is automatically created.
</P><P>
 Window contexts are never actually destroyed, so you
should be careful about the way in which you choose
to generate 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#context_id">context_id</A> values. A recommended procedure is to choose 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#context_id">context_id</A> in the range 0 to N-1 where N is the maximum number
of concurrent window contexts you plan to support.
Fortunately, once a window context has become idle
(all data generated for the most recent request and
no outstanding data chunks left), its resource consumption
is automatically reduced to an almost negligible level.
You can, of course, encourage this to happen as soon
as possible by invoking the present function with an
empty 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#window">window</A>.
</P><P>
 It is important to note that the function may need
to modify some of the window parameters in order to
satisfy internal resource constraint (or answer implicit
questions which are posed by some of the request parameters).
Moreover, the way in which this happens may depend
upon the current window handling preferences &mdash;
see 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#pref_updates">pref_updates</A>. The 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__get_window.html">get_window</A> function may be used to determine the actual window
parameters which are being used at any given point,
since the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#window">window</A> argument supplied here is not itself modified.
</P><P>
 Although this function may be called as often as needed,
there is a computational overhead associated with changes
in the window of interest. The next time 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A> is called, it will have to build a new list of active
precincts, which might easily take a milisecond or
more. Perhaps even more importantly, code-block data
for the new precincts may need to be loaded from 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> objects accessed via 
<B>kdu_serve_target::access_codestream</B>. This may indirectly trigger disk accesses, packet
parsing and cache management activities. For this reason,
once you have committed to calling 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A> in response to some new window, you should aim to
generate a significant amount of data for that window
before moving on to a new one. The actual minimum amount
of data which the application chooses to generate for
one window before moving to another might (ideally)
be based upon simultaneous estimates of the computational
complexity and the communication bandwidth to a remote
client.
</P><P>
 An important aspect of this function is the way in
which cache model manipulation instructions are handled,
as supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#model_instructions">model_instructions</A> argument. If 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#model_instructions">model_instructions</A> is non-NULL, the 
<A HREF="kdu$model__is_stateless.html">model_instructions&rarr;is_stateless</A> function must return the same value as the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#is_stateless">is_stateless</A> argument supplied here. In any case, the cache model
instructions are copied internally and processed incrementally
only on-demand. This is by far the most efficient thing
to do; however, to preserve the appearance of instantaneous
application of all cache model instructions, in the
event that a new call to 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html">set_window</A> arrives for the current window context or a different
window context, the internal machinery must either
apply all outstanding model instructions immediately
or, if appropriate, prepend them to the model instructions
(if any) associated with the new request. In any event,
the impact of these various considerations is that
you cannot rely upon the return value produced by 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__get$mage_done.html">get_image_done</A> until outstanding calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A> have completed.

If non-NULL, this argument provides (possibly) additional
information concerning user preferences. Except in
the stateless mode, preferences are persistent, so
passing a NULL or empty object in here will leave the
current preferences in place. More generally, only
those "related-pref-sets" for which information is
provided in the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#pref_updates">pref_updates</A> object are actually updated &mdash; this is done using
the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs__update.html">kdu_window_prefs::update</A> function, where you may find additional information
concerning "related-pref-sets".

<P>
For a description of cache model instructions and their
interpretation, see the definition of 
<A HREF="kdu$model.html">kdu_window_model</A>. What you need to know here is that the contents of
any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#model_instructions">model_instructions</A> object are copied internally, so you do not need to
preserve the object beyond this call. You should also
be aware that cache model instructions are actually
processed on-demand, although this should be transparent
to the application, because any new window requests
(for this or another window context), which may depend
upon the state of the internal cache model, will either
trigger the application of any outstanding model instructions,
or else prepend the outstanding cache model instructions
to those associated with the new request.
</P><P>
 For the purpose of determining cache consistency points,
where multiple window contexts are involved, you can
assume that cache model instructions are effectively
applied at the point when 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A> is first called, since the cache model instructions
were supplied via this function. Even though the instructions
might not be applied until later, this will only happen
where it does not interfere with the cache consistency
associated with the above assumption.
</P><P>
 What all this means is that a JPIP server application
should not provide a reply to a client until it has
invoked 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A>. Moreover, a client which needs to be sure that cache
model instructions sent to one JPIP channel will affect
the response to a request on a second JPIP channel
should wait until the response headers are received
for the first channel's request before sending the
second channel's request.

If true, the internal cache model contents are effectively
discarded prior to and following the generation of
all data-bin increments (may require multiple calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__gen$ncrements.html">generate_increments</A>) for this window of interest. In stateless mode, 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#context_id">context_id</A> must be 0. Moreover, the entire 
<A HREF="kdu_serve.html">kdu_serve</A> object must be used in such a way that all calls to
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html">set_window</A> have the same value for the 
<A HREF="kdu_serve__set_window.html#is_stateless">is_stateless</A> argument &mdash; an error will be generated through
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> if this is not the case.
