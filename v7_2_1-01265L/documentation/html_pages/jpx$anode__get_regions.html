Returns a pointer to the internal array of regions
(and their attributes) associated with an ROI description
box.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="jpx_roi.html">jpx_roi</A> object provides extensive tools for interpreting and
manipulating regions of interest. You should be aware
that regions of interest are generally associated with
one or more codestreams and, optionally, one or more
compositing layers via an associated number list node.
Moreover, the geometrical coordinates of the various
regions are to be interpreted with respect to the relevant
codestream's high resolution grid, expressed relative
to the upper left hand corner of the image (as defined
by the compressed codestream). This upper left hand
image corner is usually, but not always the origin
of the grid.
</P><P>
 It is legal for a JPX file to contain an ROI description
box whose regions are not associated with any codestream
or compositing layer. In that case, the geometric coordinates
are expressed with respect to the upper left hand corner
of the composited image. However, we do not recommend
this usage, since it leads to regions of interest that
have no meaning without full composition. Moreover,
it leads to regions of interest which are fundamentally
not connected with the underlying imagery. There seems
to be little or no value in allowing applications to
create new JPX regions of interest whcih have no associated
codestream, so we deliberately do not support this.
Nevertheless, existing regions of this form may have
to be handled by readers.
</P><P>
 To find the number list to which a region of interest
applies (as noted above, there should be one, but might
possibly not be), the application should search through
the ancestors of the current node for the first one
whose 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$list_info.html">get_numlist_info</A> function returns true. Since this is a common operation,
the present object provides a special function 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$container.html">get_numlist_container</A> that can do this for you.
