This structure describes a complete collection of "Related
Pref sets" as defined by the JPIP standard (IS15444-9).
These are used to express client preferences to a server.
Preferences might no be respected by a server, but
a client can identify one or more preferences as mandatory,
forcing the server to generate an error response if
it cannot support the preference. The support offered
by Kakadu's server components is likely to expand as
time goes by, but the present object represents the
complete set of preferences which a client can request.
</P><P>
 The object describes client preferences through a
set of three flag words, 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#preferred">preferred</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#required">required</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#denied">denied</A>, together with auxiliary parameters which are needed
to qualify some preferences.
</P><P>
 The idea is that a JPIP client will communicate preferred
(i.e., non-mandatory) and/or required (i.e., mandatory)
preferences to the server and keep track of any required
preferences which the server denies, so that it does
not ask again. Preferences are maintained within JPIP
sessions, so there is no need to ask again within the
same session, but a client may change its preferences
from time to time. By comparing an existing and new
<B>kdu_window_pref</B> object, it is possible for a client to figure out
what new information needs to be included in a JPIP
"pref" request and to update the existing 
<B>kdu_window_pref</B> object based upon the replies received.
</P><P>
 The name 
<B>kdu_window_pref</B> is used for this object, because the preferences which
it represents affect the way in which a server responds
to window-of-interest requests &mdash; this are encapsulated
by 
<A HREF="kdu_window.html">kdu_window</A>.

This word contains a collection of flag bits, corresponding
to each of the preference choices which can be specified
by a client. Some of these preference choices require
additional parameters, which are recorded in the object's
other members, but the additional parameters are relevant
only if the corresponding flag bit is found. There
are three flag words maintained by this object: 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#preferred">preferred</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#required">required</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#denied">denied</A>. Any given flag bit should be set in at most one of
these words.
</P><UL><LI>
If the flag bit is set in the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#preferred">preferred</A> word, the associated server behaviour is being requested
by the client as a "non-required" preference.
</LI><LI>
If the flag bit is set in the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#required">required</A> word, the associated server behaviour is being requested
by the client as a "required" preference. This is a
potential point of confusion with JPIP, which is cleared
up in Draft Ammendment 4. Requiring a preference does
not necessarily ask for it more strongly (that would
probably have no meaning anyway). Instead, it provides
a means for the client to discover whether the server
supports a preferred behaviour. More specifically,
if the server implements an algorithm to address the
behaviour associated with a required preference, it
can honour a required preference request; otherwise,
it should issue an error in response to the preference
request, along with a JPIP-pref response header. Clients
should exercise caution in requiring preferences, because
unsupported preferences must be met with an error response
and errors may possibly cause a server or client to
terminate any ongoing communication session, depending
upon the implementation.
</LI><LI>
If the flag bit is set in the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#denied">denied</A> word, the associated behaviour has been requested
by the client, but denied by the server through the
issuance of an error response with meaningful "JPIP-pref"
response headers. Once a behaviour has been denied,
it is unlikely that a future request for the same behaviour
(as a required preference) will yield a better response,
so clients should probably keep track of denied behaviours
using the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#denied">denied</A> word.
</LI></UL><P>
 The specific defined flag bits are explained below,
in relation to the JPIP standard:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE">KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE</A> is a default behaviour. It means that the server is
free to reduce the requested window of interest, in
size or resolution, as it sees fit, in order to avoid
excessive resource consumption, while striving to deliver
a quality progressive stream of data over the (possibly
adjusted) window of interest. Any changes the server
makes must be communicated explicitly to the client
via JPIP response headers, and such changes must implement
a consistent policy, meaning that if the client issues
a subsequent request for the modified window of interest,
the server should not make any further adjustments.
If this preference is required by a client, the client
wants to know whether the server provides an algorithm
which attempts to sequence the requested contents across
the entire serviced window of interest, such that the
contents are served with some sort of uniform progression
in quality &mdash; interpreted in whatever form is
most natural or realizable.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WINDOW_PREF_FULL">KDU_WINDOW_PREF_FULL</A> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE">KDU_WINDOW_PREF_PROGRESSIVE</A>. It means that the client would prefer to receive
requested windows of interest in full, even if this
means that the server has to deliver the contents in
a sequence which is not quality progressive in order
to minimize the memory it must dedicate to serving
the client &mdash; this may result in a poor experience
for interactive users, but may benefit off-line agents
which are only interested in downloading the content
of interest, in full. It makes sense to require this
preference if you need to know whether the server can
give you everything.
</LI><LI>
<B>KDU_CONCISENESSS_PREF_CONCISE</B> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_LOOSE">KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_LOOSE</A>. It means that the client would like to receive data
relating only to the requested window of interest,
meaning in particular that it does not want the server
to anticipate the client's need for additional data,
not explicitly requested. It makes very little sense
for a client to require this behaviour &mdash; remember
that requiring a preference does not make a preference
request any stronger; it only requires the server to
generate an error if it does not provide an algorithm
to implement the preference; and there is nothing specific
to implement here.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_LOOSE">KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_LOOSE</A> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_CONCISE">KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_CONCISE</A>. It means that the client is happy to allow the server
to provide additional data, deemed to be appropriate
to the request, even if it is not specifically related
to the request as stated &mdash; this is something
that a smart server might be able to do, for example.
It makes very little sense for a client to require
this behaviour, because there is no well-defined algorithm
whose support the client could expect to learn about
by requiring the preference. In fact, the only reasonable
way to use this preference is to reverse any effect
associated with a previous request for the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_CONCISE">KDU_CONCISENESS_PREF_CONCISE</A> preference.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_INCR">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_INCR</A> is a default behaviour. It means that, in the event
that a box has multiple representations induced by
placeholders in the metadata, the client would prefer
to receive incremental codestream data-bins, if available.
Failing that, the client would prefer to receive a
streaming equivalent box, if available. Otherwise,
the server should send original contents. It is worth
noting that which representations are actually available
for any given box in the metadata depends upon the
way placeholders are used, which may well be the server's
decision. However, once a placeholder structure has
been selected, the JPIP server is obliged to not alter
it, when serving the same resource with the same unique
JPIP target identifier. For this reason, you should
not interpret this preference as a request for the
server to create layouts which involve incremental
codestreams. The interpretation is that whenever the
layout involves multiple representations (the client
will discover this sooner or later), the ones the client
prefers are incremental codestreams. Requiring this
preference is a bit strange, but it would mean that
a client wants to know whether a server can deliver
incremental codestreams whenever they are available
&mdash; it has no implications for whether incremental
codestreams should be available in the logical target,
nor should the determination of whether the preference
is supported be based on whether or not incremental
codestreams appear within a specific logical target.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_EQUIV">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_EQUIV</A> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_INCR">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_INCR</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_ORIG">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_ORIG</A>. It means that the client would prefer to receive
a streaming equivalent box, if available. Failing that,
the client would prefer to receive the original box,
if available. If neither are available, the client
must be content with incremental codestreams &mdash;
these are one of the most interesting and useful features
of JPIP anyway. Requiring this preference is not to
be interpreted as requiring that the server deliver
or dynamically consruct a logical target which contains
streaming equivalent placeholders for boxes. If this
preference is required, the server should declare that
the preference is not supported, issuing an error,
unless it provides a means to return streaming equivalent
boxes wherever they happen to be present in any logical
target.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_ORIG">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_ORIG</A> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_INCR">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_INCR</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_EQUIV">KDU_PLACEHOLDER_PREF_EQUIV</A>. It means that the client would prefer to receive
the original box, if available. Failing that, the client
would prefer to receive a streaming equivalent box,
if available. If this preference is required, the client
wants to know that the server is capable of returning
original box contents for all boxes in the file, regardless
of whether they have other representations through
placeholders.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD</A> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD</A>. It means that the client would like to receive data
from multiple requested codestreams sequentially, in
increasing order of codestream index &mdash; this is
probably the default when serving video. If this preference
is required, the client wants to know whether the server
implementation is capable of deliverying codestreams
one by one for all logical targets, not just one associated
with the request in which the preference is requested.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD</A> is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD</A>. It means that the client would like to receive data
from multiple requested codestreams sequentially, in
decreasing order of codestream index. If this preference
is required, the client wants to know whether the server
implementation is capable of delivering codestreams
one by one in reverse order, for all logical targets,
not just the one associated with the request in which
the preference is requested.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_ILVD</A>is mutually exclusive with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_FWD</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD">KDU_CODESEQ_PREF_BWD</A>. It means that the client would like to receive data
from multiple requested codestreams in an interleaved
fashion so that they all improve progressively in quality,
in a sense determined by the server &mdash; this is
probably the default when serving codestreams which
contribute to a single composited JPX frame. If this
preference is required, the client wanst to know whether
the server is capable of delivering requests for multiple
codestreams in such a way that their representation
is progressively transmitted in an approximately uniform
way.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MAX_BANDWIDTH_PREF">KDU_MAX_BANDWIDTH_PREF</A> indicates that the client would like the server to
limit the total bandwidth associated with its response
data. Unlike all other preferences, this one applies
to all JPIP channels which might be present in a JPIP
session. Every other preference is stored (and potentially
respected) separately for each JPIP channel, where
the server is granting multiple channels. The actual
bandwidth limit is provided by the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#max_bandwidth">max_bandwidth</A> member. If this preference is required, the client
wants to know if the server supports global bandwidth
limiting.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_BANDWIDTH_SLICE_PREF">KDU_BANDWIDTH_SLICE_PREF</A> indicates that the client would like the server to
partition the bandwidth it assigns to different JPIP
channels within the same session in a manner which
is proportional to each channel's slice value. Slice
preferences may be sent to set each channel's slice,
but if this is not done for one or more channels, the
default slice is 1. The slice value associated with
this flag is given by the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#bandwidth_slice">bandwidth_slice</A> member. If this preference is required, the client
wants to know whether the server supports relative
distribution of available bandwidth across channels,
regardless of whether multiple channels are currently
open &mdash; if the server does not even support multiple
channels, it does not support bandwidth slicing, by
definition, so it should issue an error in response
to a client requiring this preference.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_COLOUR_METH_PREF">KDU_COLOUR_METH_PREF</A> refers to colour space preferences which are qualified
by the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#colour_meth_pref_limits">colour_meth_pref_limits</A> array, described below. If this preference is required,
it means that a client wants to know whether the server
implements the algorithm for prioritizing the delivery
of colour description boxes, regardless of whether
the current logical target contains multiple alternate
colour description boxes or not.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CONTRAST_SENSITIVITY_PREF">KDU_CONTRAST_SENSITIVITY_PREF</A> indicates that the client would prefer the server
to deliver data in a manner which is tuned to the contrast
sensitivity function described by the 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#num_csf_angles">num_csf_angles</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#max_sensitivities_per_csf_angle">max_sensitivities_per_csf_angle</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$prefs.html#csf_sensitivities">csf_sensitivities</A> members. If this preference is required, it means
that the client wants to know whether the server implements
an algorithm that can utilize any supplied constrast
sensitivity information, regardless of whether the
delivery of the current view-window would be affected
by such an algorithm.

 The four members of this array are used to identify
colour method preferences, corresponding to "enumerated"
colour spaces, "restricted ICC colour spaces", "unrestricted
ICC colour spaces" and "vendor specific colour spaces",
in that order. Each entry in the array holds a LIMIT
value on the APPROX field for colour spaces encounered
within the relevant class of colour spaces. Meaningful
values for the LIMIT lie in the range 0 to 4 and 255.
0 means that the corresponding class of colour spaces
is omitted from the preferences request. 255 means
that the corresponding class of Values was identified
by a preference request with no explicit "limit" value
&mdash; the interpretation is the same as 4 (or any
larger number) in all other respects.
</P><P>
 The recommended algorithm for the server to follow
in deciding which of multiple colour spaces to send
for any compositing layer of interest is as follows
&mdash; note, however that most servers will more than
likely just send all colour spaces, regardless, and
this is perfectly legal.
</P><UL><LI>
The server should generate a PRIORITY_i value for each
available colour space box (indexed by i) that is available
for the compositing layer in question, choosing the
colour space with lowest PRIORITY_i value to send in
preference to colour spaces with higher PRIORITY_i
value, excepting those colour spaces which the server
happens to know the client cannot support (presumably
communicated via a JPIP capabilities request field,
although capabilities requests are based on the JPX
feature box, which has lost most of its teeth due to
unworkable definitions in the original version of IS15444-2).
</LI><LI>
PRIORITY_i = APPROX_i - PREC_i if APPROX_i &gt; LIMIT
(for the relevant type of colour space).
</LI><LI>
PRIORITY_i = 1 - PREC_i if APPROX_i &lt;= LIMIT (for
the relevant type of colour spaces).
</LI><LI>
If APPROX_i is equal to 0, a large value (512) is added
to the PRIORITY_i value calculated for the i'th colour
description box so that no colour description box which
does not offer approximation information will be selected
in preference with one which is does, assuming its
colour space class is mentioned in the preference request.
</LI><LI>
If LIMIT=0, a large value (1024) is added to the PRIORITY_i
values of all colour space boxes belonging to the corresponding
colour space class (one that is not mentioned in the
preference request) so that no colour description box
belonging to an unmentioned class will be selected
in preference to one belonging to a mentioned class.
</LI></UL><P>
 Note that the above are signed quantities; the JPIP
standard uses an offset of 256 to make them unsigned,
but this only complicates the description. Note also
that high values for PREC_i correspond to more desirable
colour descriptions.
</P><P>
 Evidently, if LIMIT &lt;= 1, all colour space boxes
of the relevant type are assigned PRIORITY_i = APPROX_i
- PREC_i, since no colour space is supposed to have
APPROX_i smaller than 1. Also, if LIMIT &gt;= 4, all
priorities are obtained using the second expression
above. In generaly, specifying a larger LIMIT value
means that the client application is less concerned
about the accuracy of the colour space representation,
caring only about the PREC_i value (precedence).
</P><P>
 Now unfortunately, although IS15444-2 states that
APPROX values in JPX files should never be 0, declaring
that all JPX file writers should have better understanding
of the approximation levels of their colour space than
JP2 file writers, this does is not practically workable.
A very common scenario is that a JPX file is written
to encapsulate JP2 data, together with some important
features of JPX, such as region-of-interest metadata,
for example. In this case, it would be wrong for the
creator of such content to modify the original APPROX
value of the colour space from 0 to something else,
since that would be sheer guesswork. In our opinion,
therefore, any server which processes colour method
preferences should be able to cope with the APPROX_i=0
case. The most natural approach would be for the server
to consider all colour space boxes with APPROX_i=0
to have lower priority than any colour space box with
a non-zero APPROX_i value.
</P><P>
 A client might choose to specify a larger LIMIT if
it makes significant numerical approximations in its
implementation of colour space transformations, so
that it matters little how accurately the original
colour space parameters were expressed. Rendering tools
based upon Kakadu's 
<A HREF="jp2$erter.html">jp2_colour_converter</A> class should probably specify 3 or 4 for the LIMIT,
since this class makes a number of approximations in
order to transform colour with reasonable throughput
&mdash; in the future, it is possible that more accurate
variants will be offered. However, in practice, we
do not currently recommend that clients bother posting
any colour method preferences, since the server is
unlikely to pay any attention to them.

down) so that it fits inside the requested frame size,
and the MTF is expressed with respect to this (potentially)
scaled image. Unlike the other preferences, this one
might need to be altered regularly (if used at all),
since an interactive user may frequently change the
frame size (effectively to zoom in and out).

 It may be that a server ignores all but one angle,
for simplicity especially if the angles are non-uniformly
spaced or have different sampling densities.
