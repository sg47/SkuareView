You can use this function to traverse all nodes in
the metadata tree which have been created for the first
time, deleted, changed in any way, or explicitly touched
by 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__touch.html">jpx_metanode::touch</A>. Once a node is returned by this function, it will
not be returned again, unless it is again added onto
the internal list of touched nodes, by one of the following
events:
</P><UL><LI>
If a node's 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get_link.html">jpx_metanode::get_link</A> function could not previously follow a link to its
target, but now can (i.e., if that function returned
an empty interface previously but will now return a
non-empty interface), the node and all of its descendants
(there are not normally any, unless it is a grouping
link node) are appended to the internal touched list.
</LI><LI>
If a node is deleted, using 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__delete_node.html">jpx_metanode::delete_node</A> it will be appended to the internal list of touched
nodes. Of course, its descendants will also be deleted
and appended to the list. Remember that deleted nodes
are not physically deleted from memory; one good reason
for this is to enable applications to track such deletions
via the present function. See 
<B>is_deleted</B>.
</LI><LI>
If a node's ancestry is changed by 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cha$ge_parent.html">jpx_metanode::change_parent</A> the node and all of its descencants will be marked
as having a changed ancestry and appended to the list
of touched nodes &mdash; see 
<B>ancestry_changed</B>.
</LI><LI>
If a node's data is changed by 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cha$_to_label.html">jpx_metanode::change_to_label</A>, 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cha$o_delayed.html">jpx_metanode::change_to_delayed</A>, etc., the node will be appended to the list of touched
nodes and all of its descendants will be marked as
having a changed ancestry and also appended &mdash;
see 
<B>is_changed</B>.
</LI><LI>
If any of the node's immediate descendants is deleted
or moved to a different parent so that it is no longer
reachable via that descendant's 
<B>get_parent</B> function &mdash; see 
<B>child_removed</B>.
</LI><LI>
If 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__touch.html">jpx_metanode::touch</A> is invoked, the node and all of its descedants will
be appended to the list of touched nodes.
</LI></UL><P>
 Noting that all of the above conditions also cause
a node's descendants to be recursively appended to
the list, we are able to guarantee that any node which
experiences any of these conditions will always appear
on the touched list prior to the point at which its
descendants, if any, appear on the list. This can simplify
some applications of the function.
</P><P>
 The following two conditions can also result in a
node appearing on the touched list. These conditions
do not relate to changes in the state of the node itself,
but rather changes in the ability to recover descendants
of the node. If a node appears on the touched list
for one of these reasons and no other reason, it is
possible that its descendants appear at an earlier
location within the touched list &mdash; it is not
expected that this should complicate applications of
the function. The two conditions given below are relevant
only in the case where the ultimate source of data
is a dynamic cache, whose contents may grow in unexpected
ways.
</P><UL><LI>
If the number of descendants associated with a node
becomes known where it was not known before (see 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cou$1scendants.html">jpx_metanode::count_descendants</A>) the node will appear somewhere in the internal list
of touched nodes; it is only guaranteed to appear prior
to its descendants if it has also changed in one of
the ways described above, or recently become available
for the first time.
</LI><LI>
If any immediate descendant of a node becomes available
via 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__get$escendant.html">jpx_metanode::get_descendant</A> where it was not previously available, the node will
appear somewhere in the internal list of touched nodes;
it is only guaranteed to appear prior to its descendants
if it has also changed in one of the ways described
above, or recently become available for the first time.
</LI></UL><P>
 This function is provided to facilitate efficient
updating of application-defined structures as metadata
becomes available (e.g., from a dynamic cache) or as
metadata is edited.
</P><P>
 To find out what changes actually occurred, you can
use the functions 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__is_changed.html">jpx_metanode::is_changed</A>, 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__is_deleted.html">jpx_metanode::is_deleted</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__anc$r_changed.html">jpx_metanode::ancestor_changed</A>. All of these functions may return false if the node
is newly parsed from a data source or otherwise created,
or if the node found its way onto the touched node
list as a result of a call to 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__touch.html">jpx_metanode::touch</A>.
</P><P>
 One feature of this function is that metanodes which
are freshly created as a result of parsing an input
file are not considered to be touched until their principle
box has been completely parsed (this is the first sub-box
of an association box, or else it is the sole box associated
with the metanode). This means that every metanode
you find on the touched list is available in full,
except that its descendants, if any, might not yet
all be available. Once they become available, they
too will be added to the touched list.
