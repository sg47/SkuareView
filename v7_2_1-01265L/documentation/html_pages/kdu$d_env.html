Forenote: In Version 7.0, Kakadu's multi-threaded system
has been totally re-designed from the ground up. As
far as possible, this has been done in a way that will
have little impact on applications. However, you need
will need to note the following changes:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> objects may now be constructed by the application
and passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A>, although it is also possible to obtain internally
created thread queues using a 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A> function that is backward compatible with that found
in earlier versions of Kakadu so long as the first
argument is NULL (which it almost always was at the
application level).
</LI><LI>
The 
<B>kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</B> function has essentially been replaced by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> (although the meaning is not quite the same).
</LI><LI>
There is a special 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env__cs_terminate.html">kdu_thread_env::cs_terminate</A> function that should be called prior to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__destroy.html">kdu_codestream::destroy</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__restart__1.html">kdu_codestream::restart</A> to terminate background processing activity that may
be associated with a codestream. This is not something
that was required in the past.
</LI><LI>
The new system has much better memory management, allowing
you to work with any number of codestreams concurrently,
some of which might share their memory resources through
<A HREF="kdu$tream__sha$buffering.html">kdu_codestream::share_buffering</A>, while some might be configured for input and others
for output, without any of the complex memory management
considerations for shared thread groups that applied
in previous versions of Kakadu.
</LI><LI>
The new system should yield much better utilization
of parallel processing resources where more than 2
CPU cores are available, having a lighter-weight distributed
scheduling algorithm and mechanisms that encourage
the design of processing modules that do work only
when they know they will not have to block on dependencies.
</LI></UL><P>
 This object is required for multi-threaded processing
within a single 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A>. The main reason why this may be interesting is to
exploit the availability of multiple physical processors.
Kakadu's implementation goes to quite some effort to
minimize thread blocking and avoid cache coherency
bottlenecks which might arise in such multi-processor
environments, so as to keep all processors active close
to 100% of the time. To do this, you need to first
create a group of working threads, following the steps
below:
</P><UL><LI>
Create an instance of the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> class, either on the stack (local variable) or on
the heap (using 
<B>new</B>).
</LI><LI>
Use the base member function, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_thread</A> to add as many additional working threads to the group
as you see fit. A good strategy is to wind up with
at least one thread for each physical processor.
</LI></UL><P>
 Once you have created the thread group, it is important
that you let the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> machinery know about it. The best way to do this is
by passing a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference to the relevant 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">kdu_codestream::create</A> function, although you can wait until you first call
<A HREF="kdu$tream__open_tile.html">kdu_codestream::open_tile</A> or a related function before supplying a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference; this might be important if you want to
open a codestream before committing to the construction
of a multi-threaded environment.
</P><P>
 You should be aware that each 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object maintains a special derived version of the
<A HREF="kdu$ntext.html">kdu_thread_context</A> class that maintains safe synchronization objects
and special memory management structures. This codestream-specific
thread context, may actually create its own thread
queue (see 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>) and schedule background processing jobs within a
special background work domain. You do not directly
interact with these queues. What is important is that
you do not invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__destroy.html">kdu_codestream::destroy</A> until all multi-threaded processing within the codestream
has stopped. To do this, you must either supply the
codestream in a call to the current object's 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env__cs_terminate.html">cs_terminate</A> function, or else you must issue a global call (one
with no 
<B>root_queue</B>) to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A>, or destroy the multi-threaded processing environment
using the inherited 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__destroy.html">kdu_thread_entity::destroy</A> function.
</P><P>
 You may pass a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference into any of Kakadu's processing objects.
In the core system, these include all the objects declared
in "kdu_sample_processing.h" and "kdu_block_coding.h",
notably
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A>; and
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 Other higher level support objects, such as those
defined in the "apps/support" directory also should
be able to accept a thread group, so as to split their
work across the available threads.
</P><P>
 It is usually a good idea to create a top-level 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> object for each tile, or each tile-component (if you
are scheduling the processing of tile-components yourself)
which you want to process concurrently. This is most
easily done using the base member 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A>, but 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A> may be used for more sophisticated derived 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A> objects. You can then pass these queue into the above
objects when they are constructed, so that any internally
created job queues will be added as sub-queues (or
sub-sub-queues) of the supplied top-level queue. There
are many benefits to the queue hierarchies formed in
this way, as described in connection with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A> function. Most notably, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> function allows you to wait upon the completion of
all work within a queue and all of its sub-queues,
detaching them from the thread group once this happens.
</P><P>
 As for termination and exceptions, this is what you
need to know:
</P><UL><LI>
If you handle an exception thrown from any context
which involves your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object, you should call the base member function 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">kdu_thread_entity::handle_exception</A>. Actually, it is safe to call that function any time
at all &mdash; in case you have doubts about the context
in which you are handling an exception.
</LI><LI>
You can wait upon and detach any portion of the queue
hierarchy, using the base member function, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A>. Alternatively, you can (perhaps prematurely) terminate
and detach any portion of the queue hierarchy, using
the base member function, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A>. In order to ensure that any background processing
within a codestream completes (or terminates prematurely)
you should use the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env__cs_terminate.html">cs_terminate</A> function offered by the present object, since you
do not have direct access to the background processing
queues that might be created inside a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object.
</LI></UL><P>
 The use of various interface functions offered by
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface and its descendants can interfere with multi-threaded
processing. To avoid problems, you should pass a reference
to your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object into any such functions which can accept one.
Notably, you should identify your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object when using any of the following:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$tream__open_tile.html">kdu_codestream::open_tile</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__close.html">kdu_tile::close</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__trans_out.html">kdu_codestream::trans_out</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$bband__open_block.html">kdu_subband::open_block</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__close_block.html">kdu_subband::close_block</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 Remember: multi-threaded processing is an advanced
feature. It is designed to be as used with as little
difficulty as possible, but it is not required for
Kakadu to do everything you want. To reap the full
advantage of multi-threaded processing, your platform
should host multiple physical (or virtual) processors
and you will need to know something about the number
of available processors. The 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$_processors.html">kdu_get_num_processors</A> function might help you in this, but there is no completely
general software mechanism to detect the number of
processors in a system. You may find that it helps
to customize some of the architecture constants defined
in "kdu_arch.h", notably:
</P><UL><LI>
<B>KDU_MAX_L2_CACHE_LINE</B> and
</LI><LI>
<B>KDU_CODE_BUFFER_ALIGN</B>.
