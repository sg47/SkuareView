This function can be used to recover information about
the number of compressed bytes (together with packet
headers) encountered within each quality layer, while
parsing the tile. The information returned by the function
can be specialized to a particular image component,
or you can supply a -ve 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#component_idx">component_idx</A> argument to obtain the aggregate statistics for all
components. Similarly, the information can be specialized
to a particular resolution, by identifying a non-zero
number of highest resolution levels to discard. The
information is returned via 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and, optionally, 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_packets">layer_packets</A> (if you want to know how many packets were actually
parsed in each quality layer), each of which are arrays
with 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#num_layers">num_layers</A> entries. The function only augments the entries found
in these arrays; rather than initializing them. This
is useful, since it allows you to conveniently accumulate
results from multiple tiles, but it means that the
caller must take responsibility for initializing their
contents to zero at some point.
</P><P>
 It is most important to realize the limitations of
this function. Firstly, the function returns information
only about those packets which have actually been parsed.
It cannot predict ahead of time what the statistics
are. So, for example, you might use the function after
decompressing a tile, in order to determine how much
compressed data was processed. If you want to know
how much data will be processed, before actually decompressing
any content, you need to pre-parse the tile by calling
the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html">parse_all_relevant_packets</A> member function. There may be many benefits to doing
this, but you should be aware that the parsed content
will need to be stored internally, at least until it
is actually decompressed.
</P><P>
 In general, you may have already parsed some precincts
from the tile (or perhaps only some packets of those
precincts, if layer restrictions have been applied
via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> function). You can discover how much data has been
parsed, by supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_packets">layer_packets</A> array. These values may be compared with the function's
return value, which identifies the total number of
precincts (and hence the maximum number of packets
per layer) in the requested component (or all components)
and resolutions, allowing you to judge whether or not
it is worthwhile to call the potentially expensive
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html">parse_all_relevant_packets</A> function.
</P><P>
 Another limitation of this function is that it does
not directly respect any region of interest that you
may have specified via 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>. If you have a limited region of interest, that region
of interest will generally have an effect on the packets
which get parsed and so limit the values returned via
the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_packets">layer_packets</A> arrays. However, if the codestream did not support
random access into its precincts, the system may have
had to parse a great many more packets than those required
for your region of interest. Moreover, if you are working
with a persistent codestream, you may have changed
the region of interest multiple times. In general,
the information reported by this function represents
the collection of all packets parsed so far, except
that precincts which were unloaded from memory and
then reloaded (can happen when working with randomly
accessible persistent codestreams) are not counted
twice.
</P><P>
 A final thing to be aware of is that if your ultimate
source of data is a dynamic cache, the number of packets
actually available at the time of parsing may have
been much smaller than the number which are available
when you call this function. You can, if you like,
provoke the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__par$nt_packets.html">parse_all_relevant_packets</A> function into unloading all precincts of the tile
(at least for the resolutions and components in question)
and parsing again from scratch, collecting the relevant
statistics as it goes. Again, though, this could be
costly, and you can use the statistics reported via
the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_packets">layer_packets</A> array to determine whether or not it is worthwhile
for your intended application.

<P>
0 if the operation cannot be performed. This may occur
if the codestream was not created for input, or if
some argument is illegal. Otherwise, the function returns
the total number of precincts in the image component
(or tile if 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#component_idx">component_idx</A> is -ve) within the requested resolutions (considering
the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#discard_levels">discard_levels</A> argument). This is also the maximum number of packets
which could potentially be parsed within any given
quality layer; it may be compared with the values returned
via a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. It is worth noting that the return value does
not depend in any way upon any region of interest which
may have been specified via a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ArgS">Arguments</A></H2><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<H4><A NAME="component_idx">component_idx</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Supply -1 if you want aggregate information for all
image components. Otherwise, this should be legal codestream
component index, ranging from 0 to the value returned
by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$omponents.html">kdu_codestream::get_num_components</A>.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="discard_levels">discard_levels</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Supply 0 if you want information at full resolution.
A value of 1 returns the aggregate information for
all but the first DWT level in the image component
(or all components if 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#component_idx">component_idx</A> was -ve). Similarly, a value of 2 returns aggregate
information for all but the top two DWT levels, and
so forth. If this argument exceeds the number of DWT
levels in the image component (or all components, if
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#component_idx">component_idx</A> was -ve), the function returns 0.
</P><P>
 If you supply a -ve value for this argument, it will
be treated as zero. This is consistent with the interpretation
that the returned results should correspond to the
packets which are relevant to an identified image resolution
(hence, including packets found at all lower resolutions).
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="num_layers">num_layers</A> [<B>int</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
The number of quality layers for which you want information
returned. If this value is larger than the actual number
of quality layers, the additional entries in the supplied
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#layer_packets">layer_packets</A> arrays will be untouched. It can also be smaller than
the number of actual quality layers, if you are only
interested in a subset of the available information.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> [<B>kdu_long</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
An array with at least 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#num_layers">num_layers</A> entries. Upon successful return, the entries are augmented
by the cumulative number of parsed bytes (packet header
bytes, plus packet body bytes, including any SOP marker
segments and EPH markers), for the relevant collection
of image components and resolutions, in each successive
quality layer. Note that the number of bytes in any
given quality layer should be added to the number of
bytes in all previous quality layers, to determine
the total number of bytes associated with truncating
the representation to the quality layer in question.
This array may be NULL if you are not interested in
the number of parsed bytes.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="layer_packets">layer_packets</A> [<B>kdu_long</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Array with at least 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get$cket_stats.html#num_layers">num_layers</A> entries. Upon successful return, the entries are augmented
by the number of packets which have been parsed for
the relevant collection of image components and resolutions,
in each successive quality layer. Typically, the same
number of packets will have been parsed for all quality
layers, but layer restrictions applied via 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> may alter this situation. Also, a tile may have been
truncated. If the ultimate source of data is a dynamic
cache, the statistics may vary greatly from layer to
layer here. This array may be NULL if you are not interested
in the number of parsed packets.
