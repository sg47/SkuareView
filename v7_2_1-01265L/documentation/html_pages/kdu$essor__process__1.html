<P>
This powerful function is the workhorse of a typical
interactive image rendering application. It is used
to incrementally decompress an active region into identified
portions of one or more application-supplied buffers.
Each call to the function always decompresses some
whole number of lines of one or more horizontally adjacent
tiles, aiming to produce roughly the number of samples
suggested by the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#suggested_increment">suggested_increment</A> argument, unless that value is smaller than a single
line of the current tile, or larger than the number
of samples in a row of horizontally adjacent tiles.
The newly rendered samples are guaranteed to belong
to a rectangular region &mdash; the function returns
this region via the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#new_region">new_region</A> argument. This, and all other regions manipulated
by the function are expressed relative to the 
<B>rendering canvas</B> (the coordinate system associated with the 
<B>region</B> argument supplied to the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A> member function).
</P><P>
 Decompressed samples are automatically colour transformed,
clipped, level adjusted, interpolated and colour appearance
transformed, as necessary. The result is a collection
of rendered image pixels, each of which has the number
of channels described by the 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html#num_channels">kdu_channel_mapping::num_channels</A> member of the 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html">kdu_channel_mapping</A> object passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A> (or just one channel, if no 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html">kdu_channel_mapping</A> object was passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>). The initial 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html#num_colour_channels">kdu_channel_mapping::num_colour_channels</A> of these describe the pixel colour, while any remaining
channels describe auxiliary properties such as opacity.
Other than these few constraints, the properties of
the channels are entirely determined by the way in
which the application configures the 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html">kdu_channel_mapping</A> object.
</P><P>
 The rendered channel samples are written to the buffers
supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#channel_bufs">channel_bufs</A> array. If 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#expand_monochrome">expand_monochrome</A> is false, this array must have exactly one entry for
each of the channels described by the 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html">kdu_channel_mapping</A> object supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>. The entries may all point to offset locations within
a single channel-interleaved rendering buffer, or else
they may point to distinct buffers for each channel;
this allows the application to render to buffers with
a variety of interleaving conventions.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#expand_monochrome">expand_monochrome</A> is true and the number of colour channels (see 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html#num_colour_channels">kdu_channel_mapping::num_colour_channels</A>) is exactly equal to 1, the function automatically
copies the single (monochrome) colour channel into
3 identical colour channels whose buffers appear as
the first three entries in the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#channel_bufs">channel_bufs</A> array. This is a convenience feature to support direct
rendering of monochrome images into 24- or 32-bpp display
buffers, with the same ease as full colour images.
Your application is not obliged to use this feature,
of course.
</P><P>
 Each buffer referenced by the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#channel_bufs">channel_bufs</A> array has horizontally adjacent pixels separated by
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#pixel_gap">pixel_gap</A>. Regarding vertical organization, however, two distinct
configurations are supported.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#row_gap">row_gap</A> is 0, successive rows of the region written into 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#new_region">new_region</A> are concatenated within each channe buffer, so that
the row gap is effectively equal to 
<B>new_region.size.x</B> &mdash; it is determined by the particular dimensions
of the region processed by the function. In this case,
the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#buffer_origin">buffer_origin</A> argument is ignored.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#row_gap">row_gap</A> is non-zero, each channel buffer points to the location
identified by 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#buffer_origin">buffer_origin</A> (on the rendering canvas), and each successive row
of the buffer is separated by the amount determined
by 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#row_gap">row_gap</A>. In this case, it is the application's responsibility
to ensure that the buffers will not be overwritten
if any samples from the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A> are written onto the buffer, taking the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#buffer_origin">buffer_origin</A> into account. In particular, the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#buffer_origin">buffer_origin</A> must not lie beyond the first row or first column
of the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A>. Note that the interpretation of 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#row_gap">row_gap</A> depends upon the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#measure_row_gap_in_pixels">measure_row_gap_in_pixels</A> argument.
</P><P>
 On entry, the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A> structure identifies the subset of the original region
supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>, which has not yet been decompressed and is still
relevant to the application. The function uses this
information to avoid unnecessary processing of tiles
which are no longer relevant, unless these tiles are
already opened and being processed.
</P><P>
 On exit, the upper boundary of the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A> is updated to reflect any completely decompressed
rows. Once the region becomes empty, all processing
is complete and future calls will return false.
</P><P>
 The function may return true, with 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#new_region">new_region</A> empty. This can happen, for example, when skipping
over unnecessary tile or group of tiles. The intent
is to avoid the possibility that the caller might be
forced to wait for an unbounded number of tiles to
be loaded (possibly from disk) while hunting for one
which has a non-empty intersection with the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A>. In general, the current implementation limits the
number of new tiles which will be opened to one row
of horizontally adjacent tiles. In this way, a number
of calls may be required before the function will return
with 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#new_region">new_region</A> non-empty.
</P><P>
 If the code-stream is found to offer insufficient
DWT levels to support the 
<B>discard_levels</B> argument supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>, the present function will return false, after which
you should invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> and potentially start again with a different number
of discard levels.
</P><P>
 If the underlying code-stream is found to be sufficiently
corrupt that the decompression process must be aborted,
the current function will catch any exceptions thrown
from an application supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> handler, returning false prematurely. This condition
will be evident from the fact that 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A> is non-empty. You should still call 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> and watch the return value from that function.
</P>

False if the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A> becomes empty as a result of this call, or if a required
tile is found to offer insufficient DWT levels to support
the 
<B>discard_levels</B> values originally supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>, or if an internal error occurs during code-stream
data processing and an exception was thrown by the
application-supplied 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> handler. In any case, the correct response to a false
return value is to call 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> and check its return value.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> returns false, an error has occurred and you must
close the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object (possibly re-opening it for subsequent processing,
perhaps in a more resilient mode &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$resilient.html">kdu_codestream::set_resilient</A>).
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> returns true, the incomplete region might not have
been completed if the present function found that you
were attempting to discard too many resolution levels
or to flip an image which cannot be flipped, due to
the use of certain packet wavelet decomposition structures.
To check for the former possibility, you should always
check the value returned by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$wt_levels.html">kdu_codestream::get_min_dwt_levels</A> after 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__finish.html">finish</A> returns true. To check for the second possibility,
you should also test the value returned by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__can_flip.html">kdu_codestream::can_flip</A>, possibly adjusting the appearance of the codestream
(via 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__cha$ppearance.html">kdu_codestream::change_appearance</A>) before further processing. Note that the values returned
by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$wt_levels.html">kdu_codestream::get_min_dwt_levels</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__can_flip.html">kdu_codestream::can_flip</A> can become progressively more restrictive over time,
as more tiles are visited.
</P><P>
 Note carefully that this function may return true,
even though it has decompressed no new data of interest
to the application (
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#new_region">new_region</A> empty). This is because a limited number of new tiles
are opened during each call, and these tiles might
not have any intersection with the current 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#incomplete_region">incomplete_region</A> &mdash; the application might have reduced the incomplete
region to reflect changing interests.

Region on the rendering canvas which is still required

internally with a bank of horizontally adjacent tiles,
which may range from a single tile to an entire row
of tiles (or part of a row of tiles). From within the
current tile bank, the function decompresses lines
as required to fill out the incomplete region, discarding
any rows from already open tiles which do not intersect

that the function may decompress image data and return

tile data which intersects with the incomplete region,
but one or more tiles remain to the right of that region.
Generally speaking, the function advances the top row
of the incomplete region only when it decompresses
data from right-most tiles which intersect with that
region, or when it detects that the identity of the
right-most tile has changed (due to the width of the
incomplete region shrinking) and that the new right-most

to the original bit-depth of the compressed image samples.
The rendered sample values are written into the buffer
as B-bit unsigned integers, where B is the value of

more interest in selecting different precisions when

 From Kakadu v4.3, it is possible to supply a special

<A HREF="kdu$pping.html#default_rendering_signed">kdu_channel_mapping::default_rendering_signed</A> arrays are used to derive the default channel precisions,
as well as per-channel information about whether the
samples should be rendered as unsigned quantities or
as 2's complement 8-bit integers. That information,
in turn, is typically initialized by one of the 
<A HREF="kdu$pping__configure__1.html">kdu_channel_mapping::configure</A> functions to represent the native bit-depths and signed/unsigned
properties of the original image samples (or palette
indices); however, it may be explicitly overridden
by the application. This gives you enormous flexibility
in choosing the way you want rendered sample bits to
be represented. If no 
<A HREF="kdu$pping.html">kdu_channel_mapping</A> object was supplied to 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__start.html">start</A>, the default rendering precision and signed/unsigned
characteristics are derived from the original properties
of the image samples represented by the code-stream.

 It is worth noting that the rendering precision, B,
can actually exceed 8, either because 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#precision_bits">precision_bits</A> &gt; 8, or because 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#precision_bits">precision_bits</A>=0 and the default rendering precisions, derived in
the above-mentioned manner, exceed 8. In this case,
the function automatically truncates the rendered values
to fit within the 8-bit representation associated with
the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor__process__1.html#channel_bufs">channel_bufs</A> array(s). If B &lt;= 8, the rendered values are truncated
to fit within the B bits. Where 2's complement output
samples are written, they are truncated in the natural
way and sign extended.
