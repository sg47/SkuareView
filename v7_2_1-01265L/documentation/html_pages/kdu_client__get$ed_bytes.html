Returns the total number of bytes which have been received
from the server, including all headers and other overhead
information, in response to requests posted to the
indicated request queue.
</P><P>
 This function differs from 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$red_bytes.html">kdu_cache::get_transferred_bytes</A> in three respects: firstly, it can be used to query
information about transfer over a specific request
queue; second, it returns only the amount of data transferred
by the server, not including additional bytes which
may have been retrieved from a local cache; finally,
it includes all the transfered overhead.

<P>
One of the request queue identifiers returned by the
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> functions, or else a negative integer. In the latter
case, the function returns the total number of received
bytes belonging to all request queues, including the
internal "OOB queue" (see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__pos$b_window.html">post_oob_window</A>), since the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html">connect</A> function was last called. If this argument is not
negative and does not refer to an alive request queue
(see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A>), the function returns 0. Thus, once all queues have
been removed via the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> function, this function will return 0 for all non-negative
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$ed_bytes.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> values.

<H4><A NAME="non_idle_seconds">non_idle_seconds</A> [<B>double</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
If this argument is non-NULL, it is used to return
the total number of seconds for which the indicated
request queue has been non-idle, or (if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$ed_bytes.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> &lt; 0) the total number of seconds for which the
aggregate of all request queues managed by the client
over its lifetime has been non-idle (this includes
the internal "OOB queue" mentioned above). A request
queue is non-idle between the point at which it issues
a request and the point at which it becomes idle, as
identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_idle.html">is_idle</A> member function. The client is non-idle between the
point at which any request queue issues a request and
the point at which all request queues become idle.

<H4><A NAME="seconds_since_first_active">seconds_since_first_active</A> [<B>double</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
If non-NULL, this argument is used to return the total
number of seconds since the indicated request queue
first became active, or (if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$ed_bytes.html#queue_id">queue_id</A> &lt; 0) the total number of seconds since any request
queue in the client first became active (including
the internal "OOB queue" mentioned above). A request
queue becomes active when it first issues a request.
During the time spent resolving network addresses or
attempting to connect TCP channels prior to issuing
a request, the queue is not considered active.
