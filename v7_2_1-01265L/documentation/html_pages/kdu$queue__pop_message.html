Overriding this function is most likely the only thing
you need to do to make a useful message handling object
for multi-threaded GUI-based environments.
</P><P>
 The base function retrieves the first message from
the queue as a UTF-8 character string, returning NULL
only if there is no complete message on the queue.
If a non-NULL string is returned, the queue is advanced,
but you can be sure that the internal buffer will not
be overwritten, at least until this function is called
again. You should generally call this function from
only one thread to avoid this risk, although the internal
implementation will at least work correctly when invoked
from any thread. It is expected that the function will
be called from a context in which the internal mutex
is not locked. In particular, you should not call the
function from any overrides of the 
<A HREF="kdu$queue__put_text__1.html">put_text</A> function, nor from any override of 
<A HREF="kdu$queue__flush.html">flush</A> at least until that override invokes the base 
<A HREF="kdu$1ssage__flush.html">kdu_thread_safe_message::flush</A> function. However, you should not normally need to
concern yourself with these details because none of
those functions normally need to be overridden at all.
</P><P>
 In a typical implementation, you provide an override
of this function alone, which first checks to see if
it is being called from the thread you in which you
want to do all your message displaying &mdash; typically
the one running a window message loop. If not, the
overriding function should return NULL after taking
steps to encourage the message displaying thread to
call this function itself at some point in the future.
If the function is being called form the message displaying
thread, it should invoke the base function, whose behaviour
is described in the previous paragraph, rendering any
returned UTF-8 string in an appropriate way, and returning
once the string is no longer required (e.g., when a
user closes a window which is displaying the message).
It is up to you whether or not you block the function
until a user closes a message window (not that your
implementation has to use message windows), but this
is probably the most appropriate behaviour for an error
message handler at least. In any case, your overriding
function should return NULL once it has no more messages
to display.
</P><P>
 In a typical GUI-based application, the message displaying
thread is the thread which runs the message loop for
the window system and you define a custom message which
causes this message thread to invoke the present function
repeatedly until it returns NULL. This custom message
is delivered if this function is invoked from any other
thread. In this way, you can be sure that messages
are displayed as soon as reasonably practicable regardless
of what thread they arrive on.
