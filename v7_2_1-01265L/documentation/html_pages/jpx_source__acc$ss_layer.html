Similar to 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$destream.html">access_codestream</A> but accesses the information associated with the compositing
layer identified by 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html#which">which</A>. If 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html#which">which</A> is 0, this is the first compositing layer in the data
source; if 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html#which">which</A> is 1, the second compositing layer is being requested,
and so forth. All data sources managed by this object
are deemed to have at least one compositing layer,
even if they do not contain explicit compositing layer
header boxes. Even a basic JP2 file always has one
compositing layer and one codestream. If the data source
contains compositing layer header boxes, there is one
compositing layer for each such header box. Otherwise
(and this can only be determined by parsing to the
end of the file first), each codestream corresponds
to a separate implicit compositing layer.
</P><P>
 If the function is unable to access the requested
layer at present, it returns an empty interface (one
whose 
<A HREF="jpx$2ource__exists.html">jpx_layer_source::exists</A> function returns false). This may happen either because
the total number of compositing layers in the data
source is less than or equal to 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$ss_layer.html#which">which</A>, or because the function is not yet able to parse
far enough into the data source to recover the relevant
boxes. The latter generally occurs only if the underlying
<A HREF="jp2$y_src.html">jp2_family_src</A> object is fueled by a dynamic cache (i.e., a 
<A HREF="kdu_cache.html">kdu_cache</A> object).
</P><P>
 To be sure of eventually discovering compositing layers
that exist in the original source, consider using 
<A HREF="jpx_source__gen$_metareq.html">generate_metareq</A> to augment client window requests that you send to
a JPIP server.
</P><P>
 Before the function will return a non-empty interface,
it must have found and parsed the relevant compositing
layer header (JPLH) box, if any, in addition to any
JP2 header (jp2h) box which is required for recovering
default parameters, and any codestream header box whose
component mapping box might be required to interpret
channel mapping rules. Alternatively, we must have
reached the end of the data source or have other means
of knowing that there will be no compositing layer
header box for this layer. These complexities arise
because JPX was created to allow quite a bit of flexibility
for writers, but this has obvious adverse implications
for readers, leaving them unable to make solid incremental
decisions often until all boxes have been seen. The
Kakadu implementation does its best to hide all such
irregularities from the application.
</P><P>
 For sources with a very large number of compositing
layers, the introduction of JPX containers (Compositing
Layer Extensions boxes) with KDU-7.2 can allow readers
to figure out what is going on in a complex JPX file
much more quickly, since they greatly reduce the number
of top-level boxes that must appear within the file.
</P><P>
 Before the function will return a non-empty interface,
each of the associated codestreams must also be sufficiently
available, meaning that the 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$destream.html">access_codestream</A> function would return a non-empty interface when invoked
with each of their identifiers.

If true, each codestream associated with a returned
non-empty interface can be successfully accessed by
calling 
<A HREF="jpx_source__acc$destream.html">access_codestream</A> with a 
<B>need_main_header</B> argument of true. Otherwise, successful access of
each required codestream is only guaranteed with a
false value for the
