This powerful function modifies all "path brick" regions,
as defined under 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A>, so as to ensure that the "thickness" of the regions
which define path segments is as close as possible
to the supplied value. Only true path bricks are modified,
as opposed to "potential path bricks". The function
also modifies any elliptical region whose centre lies
at the end-point of a path segment, setting such ellipses
to circles whose diameter is as close as possible to
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html#thickness">thickness</A>.
</P><P>
 The function is careful not to alter the path segments
themselves in any way. The thickness of a path brick
is defined to be the distance between the two edges
which run on either side of the brick's path segment.
The path segment itself runs between the mid-points
of the other two edges.
</P><P>
 The compatible edges associated with path bricks are
modified in pleasing ways, according to the following
policy:
</P><UL><LI>
If the end of a path segment lies at an edge which
is not a compatible edge, or which is shared with an
ellipse (as defined above), that edge is aligned perpendicularly
to the path segment.
</LI><LI>
If the end of a path segment lies at a compatible edge
of non-zero extent (i.e., the end-points of the edge
are not the same point), which is not shared with any
ellipse, the edge is modified simultaneously in both
quadrilaterals, so as to preserve the sharing property.
If both quadrilaterals are path bricks, this is done
in such a way that the thicknesses of both path bricks
is established.
</LI></UL><P>
 Note that the 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html#thickness">thickness</A> value is interpreted with respect to the notion that
each individual sample point has a size of 1x1. Thus,
a 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html#thickness">thickness</A> of 1 means that each path brick has only two distinct
vertices, so that the path brick region is actually
a line which coincides with the path segment itself.
As a general rule, it is better to request odd valued
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html#thickness">thickness</A> values, since path bricks which run horizontally or
vertically can achieve such thicknesses precisely.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that isolated path bricks (i.e.,
quadrilateral regions which do not share any edges
with other quadrilaterals) must not be as thick as
their path segment is long &mdash; otherwise, the path
segment would switch to run between the opposite two
edges (see the explanation under 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__enum_paths.html">enum_paths</A>). The function imposes this restriction automatically.

Used to indicate whether or not the operation was able
to successfully modify all path bricks and path junctions.
If none of them were modified, or only a subset were
modified, the function sets 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html#success">success</A> to false. Otherwise, it sets 
<A HREF="jpx$ditor__set$thickness.html#success">success</A> to true.
