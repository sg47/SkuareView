This function may be used by server applications to
determine an appropriate number of packets to deliver
to a client in a single batch. Applications interact
with the 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html">size_packets</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__get_packets.html">get_packets</A> functions in an alternating fashion.
</P><P>
 The application first calls 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html">size_packets</A> one or more times to determine the number of bytes
associated with a certain number of packets or vice-versa
(see below). It then calls 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__get_packets.html">get_packets</A> to actually generate the data bytes from a range of
packets. Thereafter, the application may go back to
sizing packets again and so forth. Between sizing and
generating packet data, the internal packet coding
state machinery is reset, which incurs some computational
effort. For this reason, it is desirable to keep the
number of switches between sizing and generating packet
data to a minimum.
</P><P>
 During a single sizing session (i.e., after the last
generation session, if any, and before the next one),
the internal machinery keeps track of the number of
packets which have been sized already. It also keeps
track of the total number of bytes represented by these
sized packets. If the number of sized packets is less
than the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_packets">cumulative_packets</A> on entry, or if the total size of all packets sized
so far (starting from the first packet of the precinct)
is less than 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_bytes">cumulative_bytes</A>, the function sizes one or more additional packets.
This continues until the number of sized packets reaches
or exceeds the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_packets">cumulative_packets</A> and the total number of bytes associated with these
sized packets reaches or exceeds the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_bytes">cumulative_bytes</A>. The function returns after setting the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_packets">cumulative_packets</A> to reflect the total number of sized packets and the
value of 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_bytes">cumulative_bytes</A> to reflect the total number of bytes associated with
all packets sized so far.
</P><P>
 Once the number of sized packets reaches the number
of apparent quality layers, as set by any call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>, the function will return without attempting to size
further packets.
</P><P>
 The behaviour described above may be exploited in
a variety of ways. If a server has already transmitted
some number of packets to a client, the number of bytes
associated with these packets may be determined by
setting 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_bytes">cumulative_bytes</A> to 0 and setting 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_packets">cumulative_packets</A> equal to the number of packets which have been transmitted.
Alternatively, if the server remembers the number of
bytes which have been transmitted, this may be converted
into a number of packets by calling the function with
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_bytes">cumulative_bytes</A> equal to the number of transmitted bytes and 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__size_packets.html#cumulative_packets">cumulative_packets</A> equal to 0. The server may then use the function to
determine the number of additional layers which can
be transmitted, subject to a given size restriction.
The results of such simulations may be used to drive
the 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__get_packets.html">get_packets</A> function. In this way, it is possible to implement
memory efficient servers whose state information consists
of as little as a single 16-bit integer (sufficient
for packets consisting of only a few blocks) for each
precinct, representing the number of bytes actually
transmitted for that precinct's packets.
</P><P>
 Remember, that after generating packet data with 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__get_packets.html">get_packets</A>, sizing calls start from scratch with the first packet
in the precinct.

False if one or more of the precinct's code-blocks
have yet to be loaded (
<A HREF="kdu$cinct__check_loaded.html">check_loaded</A> would return false); in this case, the function does
nothing else.
