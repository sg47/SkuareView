This function is similar to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A> but may be used to learn about the status of a broader
set of successfully posted windows or to find the most
recently posted window with a particular status. The
utility of the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> argument here is greater than in 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A> and the function can also provide information about
the amount of time for which response data has been
arriving &mdash; the service time.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> values both have significance on entry to the function,
and both are potentially modified by the function,
unless the return value is false. If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> is -ve on entry, the entry value of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> determines the posted window for which the function
is being asked to return information. Otherwise, the
function is being asked to return information about
the most recently posted window for which any of the
supplied flags is valid; for more on this, see the
description of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A>.
</P><P>
 Windows that have been successfully posted take various
states within their queue, based on information received
from or sent to the server. Specifically, a posted
window can be in one of the following states:
</P><UL><LI>
pending request &mdash; no request has yet been sent
to the server.
</LI><LI>
pending reply &mdash; no reply to an issued request
yet.
</LI><LI>
replied &mdash; server reply paragraph has been received.
</LI><LI>
response started &mdash; at least some response data
has been received (or else the response has been terminated).
</LI><LI>
response terminated &mdash; all response data received
(usually identified by the server's EOR message), although
the request might have been pre-empted by a later one.
</LI></UL><P>
 If two consecutive successfully posted windows have
identical windows of interest, but distinct 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> values, they are both assigned places in the request
queue &mdash; so long as the second one at least is
non-preemptive.
</P>

The function returns false if no posted window can
be found, that matches the information provided via
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A>. This may happen if the request queue is no longer
alive (see 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A>), if the window was never posted, if the window was
removed from the queue due to the appearance of a later
pre-emptive request, or if all communication for the
window has finished (terminated state) and there is
at least one later window for which a reply has been
received from the server, so that the terminated window
drops off the end of the queue.

This argument has a related interpretation to its namesake
in 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A>, but there is an expanded set of possible flags. However,
this argument is used both to constrain the request
(entry value) and, if the function returns true, to
learn about the status of the relevant posted window
(exit value). The defined flags have the following
interpretation:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_UNREQUESTED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_UNREQUESTED</A> &mdash; this flag means that the relevant posted window
is still pending the issuance of a request to the server.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_UNREPLIED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_UNREPLIED</A> &mdash; this flag means that the relevant posted window
is still pending the receipt of a server reply paragraph.
Unrequested windows are of course also unreplied.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_MOST_RECENT">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_MOST_RECENT</A> &mdash; this flag means that the relevant posted window
is the most recent one to be requested from the server.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_STARTED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_STARTED</A> &mdash; this flag means that at least one byte of
response data has been received for the relevant posted
window, or the response is complete.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_TERMINATED">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_RESPONSE_TERMINATED</A> &mdash; this flag means that the server has finished
responding to the request associated with the relevant
posted window and there are no internal duplicates
of the request which have been delivered or are waiting
to be delivered (internal duplicates are created to
implement the client's flow control algorithm or to
synthesize virtual JPIP channels by interleaving requests
over a real JPIP channel). Windows for which this the
response is terminated of course also have the response-started
status.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE">KDU_CLIENT_WINDOW_IS_COMPLETE</A> &mdash; this flag is set if the server has finished
responding to the request associated with this window
and the response data renders the client's knowledge
of the source complete, with respect to the requested
elements. There is no need to post any further requests
with the same parameters, although doing so will cause
no harm.
</LI></UL><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> is -ve on entry, the function is being asked to return
information about the most recently requested window
that was posted using the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> values provided by that argument.
</P><P>
 Otherwise, the value of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> on entry is ignored and the function is being asked
to return information for the most recently requested
window for which at least one of the supplied status
flags will be set on exit.
</P><P>
 On exit, 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> is modified to reflect the status of the relevant
posted window, unless the function returns false.
</P>

Used to return (and possibly specify) the custom-id
value associated with the relevant posted window. As
mentioned above, if 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> is 0 on entry, the function looks for the most recently
posted request for which 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A> was supplied to the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> function. Otherwise, this argument is used only to
return the posted window's 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A>. The value of this argument is not modified unless
the function returns true and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#status_flags">status_flags</A> was negative on entry.

</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="window">window</A> [<A HREF ="kdu_window.html">kdu_window</A>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This argument may be NULL, in which case the caller
is not interested in recovering details of the window
of interest associated with 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#custom_id">custom_id</A>. If non-NULL, the information retrieved by this argument
might differ from that passed to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> if a reply has already been received from the server
&mdash; this is explained with 
<B>get_window_in_process</B>.
</P><P>
 If the function returns false, it does not modify
the contents of any 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$dow_info.html#window">window</A> object passed here &mdash; note that this behaviour
is different from that of 
<A HREF="kdu_client__get$progress.html">get_window_in_progress</A>.

<H4><A NAME="service_usecs">service_usecs</A> [<B>kdu_long</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
If non-NULL, this argument is used to return the total
number of microseconds that have ellapsed from the
point at which the first response data arrived from
the server for the relevant posted window until the
current time, or the point at which the response data
for the window request was terminated, whichever comes
first. If no response data has been received, the value
is set to 0. If any response data has been received,
the value is set to a positive quantity (i.e., at least
1 microsecond, even if the amount of service time is
strictly less than 1 microsecond).
