<P>
Use this function to create an instance of the internal
processing machinery, for decompressing data associated
with the supplied open 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#tile">tile</A> interface. Until you call this function (or copy another
object which has been created), the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__exists.html">exists</A> function will return false.
</P><P>
 Note carefully that the output components which will
be decompressed are affected by any previous calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>. You may use either of the two forms of that function
to modify the set of output components which appear
to be present. If called with an 
<B>access_mode</B> argument of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A>, the present object will present codestream image
components as though they were the final output image
components. If, however, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> was called with a component 
<B>access_mode</B> argument of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A>, or if it has never been called, the present object
will present output components in their fullest form,
after processing by any required inverse multi-component
decomposition, if necessary. In either case, the set
of components which is presented is identical to that
which appears via the various 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface functions, such as 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$omponents.html">kdu_codestream::get_num_components</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bit_depth.html">kdu_codestream::get_bit_depth</A>, and so forth, in each case with the optional 
<B>want_output_comps</B> argument set to true.
</P><P>
 The behaviour of this function is affected by calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__set$f_interest.html">kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest</A>. In particular, any of the apparent output components
which have been identified as uninteresting, will not
be generated by the multi-component transformation
network &mdash; they will, instead, appear to contain
constant sample values. Of course, you will probably
not want to access these constant components, or else
you would not have marked them as uninteresting; however,
you can access them if you wish without incurring any
processing overhead.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments may be used to implement a a variety of
multi-threaded processing paradigms, to leverage the
capabilities of multi-processor platforms. To see how
this works, consult the description of these arguments
below. Also, play close attention to the use of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> arguments with the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__destroy.html">destroy</A> functions.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#flags">flags</A> argument works together with subsequent arguments
to control internal memory allocation, flow control
and optimization policies. See below for a description
of the available flags.
</P><P>
 If you are working with tiled images and you are intending
to create multiple 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> engines from which image component lines will be retrieved
in round-robbin fashion (typical for scan-line oriented
processing of tiled imagery), it may be worth paying
attention to the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START</A> flag and the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__start.html">start</A> function, both of which are new to Kakadu v7, where
they play an important role in maximizing the efficiency
for multi-threaded processing environments involving
a large number of threads.

Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
multi-threaded processing. After creating a cooperating
thread group by following the procedure outlined in
the description of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>, any one of the threads may be used to construct this
processing engine. Separate processing queues will
automatically be created for each image component.
</P><P>
 If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A> flag (or the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF</A> flag) is supplied, these queues will also be used
to schedule the spatial wavelet transform operations
associated with each image component as jobs to be
processed asynchronously by different threads. Regardless
multi-threaded DWT processing is requested, within
each tile-component, separate queues are created to
allow simultaneous processing of code-blocks from different
subbands.
</P><P>
 By and large, you can use this object in exactly the
same way when 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL as you would with a NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> argument. That is, the use of multi-threaded processing
can be largely transparent. However, you must remember
the following three points:
</P><UL><LI>
You must supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> function &mdash; it need not belong to the same thread
as the one used to create the object here, but it must
belong to the same thread group.
</LI><LI>
Whereas single-threaded processing commences only with
the first call to 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A>, multi-threaded processing may have already commenced
before this function returns. That is, other threads
may be working in the background to decode code-blocks,
perform DWT synthesis and so forth, and this may start
happening even before the present function returns.
Of course, this is exactly what you want, to fully
exploit the availability of multiple processing resources.
</LI><LI>
If you are creating multiple 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> objects that you intend to use concurrently (retrieving
lines from their 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> functions in round-robbin fashion), you are recommended
to follow the startup protocol associated with the
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__start.html">start</A> function and the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START</A> creation flag.
</LI></UL>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="env_queue">env_queue</A> [<A HREF ="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. When 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL, all thread queues that are created inside
this object are added as sub-queues of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>. If 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is NULL, they are added as top-level queues in the
multi-threaded queue hierarchy. The present object
creates one internal queue for each tile-component,
to which each subband adds a sub-queue managed by 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>.
</P><P>
 One advantage of supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is that it provides you with a single hook for joining
with the completion of all the thread queues which
are created by this object and its descendants &mdash;
see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__join.html">kdu_thread_entity::join</A> for more on this.
</P><P>
 A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is that it allows you to manipulate the sequencing
indices that are assigned by the thread queues created
internally &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue</A> for more on the role played by sequencing indices
in controlling the order in which work is actually
done. In particular, if 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is initially added to the thread group with a sequencing
index of N &gt;= 0, all processing within all tile-components
of the tile associated with this object will proceed
with jobs having a sequence index of N.
</P><P>
 Finally, the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> object supplied here provides a mechanism to determine
whether or not calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> might potentially block. This may be achieved by supplying
an 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> object whose 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies</A> function has been overridden, or by registering a
dependency monitor (see 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__set$_monitor.html">kdu_thread_queue::set_dependency_monitor</A>) with the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>. If the number of potentially blocking dependencies
identified by either of these mechanisms is 0, calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> can be invoked at least once for each component index,
without blocking the caller. Otherwise, the caller
might be temporarily blocked while waiting for dependencies
to be satisfied by DWT synthesis and/or subband decoding
operations that are still in progress. This temporary
blocking is not a huge concern, since threads actually
enter what we call a "working wait", using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition</A>, during which they will often perform other tasks.
However, working waits can adversely affect cache utilization
and often cause work to be done in a less than ideal
sequence, so that other threads might go idle while
waiting for jobs to be scheduled by a thread that is
unduly delayed in a working wait. For this reason,
advanced implementations are offered the option of
using the dependency analysis methods associated with
an 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> to schedule jobs only when it is known that they are
fully ready to proceed.

Controls the internal memory allocation, buffer management
and various processing and optimization options. This
argument may be the logical OR of any appropriate combination
of the flags listed below. For convenience, the 
<B>KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DEFAULT_FLAGS</B> value may be used as a starting point, which will
supply the flags that should always be present unless
you have good reason not to include them.
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START</A>: This option is important in heavily multi-threading
environments, if you are creating multiple 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> objects and you wish to use them concurrently &mdash;
i.e., you wish to retrieve lines from them in round-robbin
fasion, as opposed to pulling all the data from one
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> engine via its 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> function and then moving onto the next one. By default
(i.e., without this flag), the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html">create</A> function causes as many processing jobs as possible
to be scheduled as soon as possible to service this
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object. However, if you want to work concurrently
with multiple 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> engines (typically to retrieve data from a collection
of adjacent tiles), it is better if the processing
jobs that service all these engines are scheduled in
an interleaved fashion. To achieve this, you may supply
this flag during the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html">create</A> call and then you should invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__start.html">start</A> function before attempting to retrieve image component
lines with 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A>. The 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__start.html">start</A> function should be invoked repeatedly on all concurrent
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> objects, in round-robbin fashion, until all calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__start.html">start</A> return true.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE</A>: This option requests the internal machinery to work
with 32-bit representations for all image component
samples. Otherwise, the internal machinery will determine
a suitable representation precision, making every attempt
to use lower precision processing paths, which are
faster and consume less memory, so long as this does
not unduly compromise quality.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_FAST">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_FAST</A>: This option represents the opposite extreme in precision
selection to that associated with 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE</A>. In fact, if both flags are supplied, the present
one will be ignored. Otherwise, if the present flag
is supplied, the function selects the lowest possible
internal processing precision, even if this does sacrifice
some image quality. This mode is normally acceptable
for rendering to low precision displays (e.g., 8 to
12 bits/sample).
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_SKIPYCC">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_SKIPYCC</A>: Omit this flag unless you are quite sure that you
want to retrieve raw codestream components without
inverting any Part-1 decorrelating transform (inverse
RCT or inverse ICT) which might otherwise be involved.
For this to make sense, you should be sure that the
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> function has been used to set the component access
mode to 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A> rather than 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A>.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF</A>: Same as 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A> &mdash; see below.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A>: This flag is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. It specifies that the spatial DWT operations
associated with each codestream image component should
be executed as asynchronous jobs, as opposed to synchronously
when new imagery is pushed in via the 
<B>exchange_line</B> function. When the flag is present, the object allocates
an internal buffer which can hold (approximately) 2*
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A> lines for each codestream tile-component. In the simplest
case (double buffering), this buffer is partitioned
into two parts. More generally, though, the implementation
may partition the memory into a larger number of parts
to improve performance. At any given time, the MCT
machinery may be reading data from one part while the
DWT and block decoding machinery may be working to
write data to another part. Multi-threaded DWT processing
provides a useful mechanism for minimizing CPU idle
time, since multiple threads can be scheduled not only
to block decoding operations, but also to DWT synthesis
operations. If DWT synthesis is the bottleneck, it
fundamentally limits the rate at which block decoding
jobs can be made available to the multi-threaded machinery;
the only way to overcome this bottleneck, if it exists,
is to allocate multiple threads to DWT synthesis via
this flag.

This argument must be strictly positive. It is used
to size the internal buffers used to hold data that
is obtained via DWT synthesis and/or block decoding
within individual codestream tile-components, while
it is waiting to be processed by the MCT machinery.
</P><P>
 From KDU-7.2.1 on, a value of 0 is automatically translated
to 1, while a -ve value may be supplied for this argument,
in which case the buffers will be dimensioned automatically,
taking the tile width and number of components into
account.
</P><P>
 There are two important cases to understand:
</P><UL><LI>
If the DWT processing is performed in-line, in the
same thread as that which calls 
<B>pull_line</B>, then there is only one buffer, with this number of
rows, and the buffer must be empty before DWT processing
is performed. In this case, it is usually best to select
the default value of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A>=1 so that DWT processing occurs as close as possible
to the point at which the synthesized sample values
are consumed. This minimizes the chance that the DWT
synthesis results will be evicted from lower levels
of the CPU cache before they are consumed via the 
<B>pull_line</B> function. However, in the special case where multi-threaded
processing is employed, with both 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> AND 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments to this function being non-NULL, and where
the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> or one of the super-queues in its ancestry advertises
its interest in propagated dependency information (through
an overridden 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue__upd$ndencies.html">kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies</A> function that returns true, for example, or an installed
dependency monitor), then there are some multi-threaded
synchronization overheads associated with the onset
and completion of the internal DWT synthesis machinery
(perhaps amounting to several hundred or even a thousand
clock cycles), so in this case it may be better to
select a larger value for 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A>, especially where the line width is small.
</LI><LI>
If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT</A> or 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF">KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF</A> flag is present, the DWT operations are performed
by jobs that may be executed on any thread within the
multi-threaded environment associated with the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#env">env</A> argument. In this case, for reasons of backward compatibility,
the total amount of memory allocated for buffering
tile-component lines is given (at least approximately)
by 2*
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create__1.html#buffer_rows">buffer_rows</A>, since this is what would be consumed if a double
buffering strategy were employed. In reality, the internal
implementation may partition this total amount of memory
into a larger number of smaller buffers so that processing
can start earlier and the memory can be used more effectively
to manage interruption of threads, or scheduling of
thread resources temporarily to other jobs.
</LI></UL><P>
 You may need to play with this parameter to optimize
processing efficiency for particular applications.
</P><P>
 You should be aware that the actual number of buffer
lines allocated internally may be smaller than that
requested. For example, the implementation may limit
the total amount of buffer memory to 256 lines.
