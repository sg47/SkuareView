This object provides a high level interface to the
Kakadu compression machinery, which is capable of satisfying
the needs of most developers while providing essentially
a one-function-call solution for simple applications.
Most new developers will probably wish to base their
compression applications upon this object.
</P><P>
 It should be noted, however, that some performance
benefits can be obtained by creating compression engines
yourself and directly passing them 
<A HREF="kdu$e_buf.html">kdu_line_buf</A> lines, since this can often avoid unnecessary copying
and level shifting of image samples. Nevertheless,
there has been a lot of demand for a dead-simple, yet
also powerful interface to Kakadu, and this object
is intended to fill that requirement. In fact, the
various objects found in the "support" directory (
<A HREF="kdu$1essor.html">kdu_stripe_compressor</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$essor.html">kdu_region_decompressor</A>) are aimed at meeting the needs of 90% of the applications
using Kakadu. That is not to say that these objects
are all that is required. You still need to open streams
of one form or another and create a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface.
</P><P>
 In a typical compression application based on this
object, you will need to do the following:
</P><UL><LI>
Create a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object;
</LI><LI>
Use the interface recovered using 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__access_siz.html">kdu_codestream::access_siz</A> to install any custom compression parameters you have
in mind, unless you are happy with all the defaults;
</LI><LI>
Initialize the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor.html">kdu_stripe_compressor</A> object, by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">kdu_stripe_compressor::start</A>.
</LI><LI>
Push image stripes into 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html">kdu_stripe_compressor::push_stripe</A> until the image is fully compressed (you can do it
all in one go, from a memory buffer of your choice,
if you like);
</LI><LI>
Call 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__finish.html">kdu_stripe_compressor::finish</A>.
</LI><LI>
Call 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__destroy.html">kdu_codestream::destroy</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 For a tuturial example of how to use the present object
in a typical application, consult the Kakadu demo application,
"kdu_buffered_compress".
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that this object is built directly
on top of the services offered by 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A>, so for a thorough understanding of how things work,
you might like to consult the documentation for that
object as well.
</P><P>
 Most notably, the image components which are supplied
to the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__push_stripe__1.html">push_stripe</A> function are those which are known (during decompression)
as multi-component output components (or just output
components). This means that the present object inverts
any Part 2 multi-component transformation network,
which may be involved.
</P><P>
 From Kakadu version 5.1, this object offers multi-threaded
processing capabilities for enhanced throughput. These
capabilities are based upon the options for multi-threaded
processing offered by the underlying 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> object and the 
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> objects which it, in turn, uses. Multi-threaded processing
provides the greatest benefit on platforms with multiple
physical CPU's, or where CPU's offer hyperthreading
capabilities. Interestingly, although hyper-threading
is often reported as offering relatively little gain,
Kakadu's multi-threading model is typically able to
squeeze 30-50% speedup out of processors which offer
hyperthreading, in addition to the benefits which can
be reaped from true multi-processor (or multi-core)
architectures.
</P><P>
 To take advantage of multi-threading, you need to
create a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object, add a suitable number of working threads to
it (see comments appearing with the definition of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>) and pass it into the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A> function. You can re-use this 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object as often as you like &mdash; that is, you need
not tear down and recreate the collaborating multi-threaded
environment between calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__finish.html">finish</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A>. Multi-threading could not be much simpler. The only
thing you do need to remember is that all calls to
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A>, 
<B>process</B> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__finish.html">finish</A> should be executed from the same thread &mdash; the
one identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A>. This constraint represents a slight loss of flexibility
with respect to the core processing objects such as
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A>, which allow calls from any thread. In exchange, however,
you get simplicity. In particular, you only need to
pass the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object into the 
<A HREF="kdu$1essor__start.html">start</A> function, after which the object remembers the thread
reference for you.
