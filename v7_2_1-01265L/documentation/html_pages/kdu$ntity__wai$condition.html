This function plays a very important role in maximizing
thread processing resources. The call must arrive from
within the current object's thread &mdash; if another
thread calls this function an error may be generated,
or the behaviour may be completely unpredictable, depending
on the implementation.
</P><P>
 Typically, the caller has previously invoked 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__get$condition.html">get_condition</A> and left behind a record of the resulting pointer
for some other thread (possibly itself) to pick up
in the future and pass to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__sig$condition.html">signal_condition</A>, once the relevant condition is fulfilled. This is
the mechanism that should be used by any processing
agent (typically derived from 
<A HREF="kdu$2queue.html">kdu_thread_queue</A>) if a caller asks for data that depends on the availability
of resources from other asynchronous processing agents.
</P><P>
 The function may ultimately invoke 
<B>kdu_thread::wait_for_signal</B>, but before doing so, the caller will be dispatched
to process any outstanding jobs which it can legitimately
perform within the thread group's domains &mdash; basically,
any outstanding jobs in any domain. In doing so, the
thread may pass back into this function to wait for
another condition. Conditions are set up on an internal
stack, so the pointer returned by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__get$condition.html">get_condition</A> will generally differ from that returned by a previous
call, if the thread has subsequently entered (but not
yet left) the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> function.
</P><P>
 You should be aware that calls to this function may
throw an exception if any part of the multi-threaded
system fails for some reason.
</P><P>
 You should also note that calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__get$condition.html">get_condition</A> do not reset the "signalled" state of a thread condition,
but the present function does reset the "signalled"
state of the thread condition when it returns.
</P><P>
 This function is used quite extensively inside the
core data processing machinery associated with the
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> objects, each of which creates and attaches queues,
schedules jobs, and implements waits in order to make
push/pull data calls look synchronous. As discussed
with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A> function, these waits are "working waits", because
other work can be done by the thread while it waits
for the condition to occur. Entering the working wait
state within those objects is generally safe with regard
to deadlock possibilities. However, if you intend to
create your own queues for scheduling your own custom
jobs, it is conceivable that deadlocks could be created
if your custom jobs invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> themselves. To avoid this risk, you are advised to
pass the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT">KDU_THREAD_QUEUE_SAFE_CONTEXT</A> flag to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__attach_queue.html">attach_queue</A> when attaching your custom queues.

<P>
To assist in identifying the cause of any deadlock
that might occur you are encouraged to provide a text
string here that explains what you are waiting for.
This string will be included in the debugging report
printed in the event that a deadlock is detected. Of
course, we do not expect deadlocks, because the system
has been designed very carefully, but bugs are possible
and, more likely, a deadlock may result from misuse
of some of the most sensitive multi-threading API calls.
