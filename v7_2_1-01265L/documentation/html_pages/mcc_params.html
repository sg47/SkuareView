Manages the information associated with a JPEG2000
<B>MCC</B> (Multi-component transform Component Collection) marker
segment. MCC marker segments describe a single multi-component
transform stage. The complete transform consists of
a sequence of stages which are referenced by a 
<B>MCO</B> (Multi-Component Order) marker segment (see 
<A HREF="mco_params.html">mco_params</A>). Each stage processes a collection of input image
components, producing a collection of output image
components. The processing proceeds via one or more
independent transform blocks, each of which produces
a so-called "component collection". The actual coefficients
of the transforms in each block are managed by 
<A HREF="mct_params.html">mct_params</A>, unless the transform is implemented using a discrete
wavelet transform, in which case the coefficients are
described by an 
<A HREF="atk_params.html">atk_params</A> (Arbitrary Transform Kernels) object.
</P><P>
 As with 
<A HREF="mct_params.html">mct_params</A> and 
<A HREF="atk_params.html">atk_params</A>, tile-specific forms of this object are allowed and
multiple instances are treated like components for
the purpose of inheritance (see the 
<B>treat_instances_like_components</B> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A> constructor).
</P><P>
 The instance number of the 
<A HREF="mcc_params.html">mcc_params</A> object is referenced by the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstages">Mstages</A> attribute managed by 
<A HREF="mco_params.html">mco_params</A>. These instance numbers must be in the range 0 through
255.
</P><P>
 The cluster name is "MCC", but you are recommended
to use the macro 
<A HREF="globals.html#MCC_params">MCC_params</A>, in functions which take a cluster name like 
<A HREF="kdu_params__acc$_cluster__1.html">kdu_params::access_cluster</A>.
</P><P>
 The following attributes are defined. For an explanation
of pattern strings, consult the comments appearing
with 
<A HREF="kdu_params__par$e_string__1.html">kdu_params::parse_string</A>.
</P><UL><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_inputs">Mstage_inputs</A>; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; This attribute
is used to describe a list of input component indices
which are used by all transforms in the stage. This
list of component indices is a concatenation of the
index ranges &lt;A1&gt;-&lt;B1&gt;, &lt;A2&gt;-&lt;B2&gt;,
..., where An &lt;= Bn are the first and second fields
in the n'th record of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_inputs">Mstage_inputs</A> attribute. The list of input component indices may
contain repeated values, but must cover all components
produced by the previous stage (or all codestream component
indices, if this is the first stage). In particular,
it must always include 0. The first transform block
operates on the first N1 components identified by this
list; the second transform block operates on the next
N2 components in this list; and so forth.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_outputs">Mstage_outputs</A>; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; This attribute
is used to describe a list of output component indices
which are produced by this stage. This list of component
indices is a concatenation of the index ranges &lt;A1&gt;-&lt;B1&gt;,
&lt;A2&gt;-&lt;B2&gt;, ..., where An &lt;= Bn are the
first and second fields in the n'th record of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_outputs">Mstage_outputs</A> attribute. The list of output component indices may
not contain any repeated component indices, but it
may contain "holes". The transform stage is considered
to generate components with indices from 0 to the largest
index in the output list; any components in this range
which are not listed (these are the holes) are taken
to be identically equal to 0. The first transform block
in the stage processes the first N1 components in the
list to produce the first M1 components in the output
list; the second transform block in the stage processes
the next N1 components in the input list, producing
the next M2 components in the output list; and so forth.
</LI><LI>
Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_collections">Mstage_collections</A>; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; This attribute
provides the values Nc and Mc which appear in the descriptions
of 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_inputs">Mstage_inputs</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_outputs">Mstage_outputs</A>, for each transform block (equivalently, each component
collection), c. The 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_collections">Mstage_collections</A> parameter attribute should contain one record for
each transform. Each record contains two strictly positive
integers, identifying the number of input components
Nk, and the number of output components, Mk, produced
by the k'th transform. No transform may consume or
produce 0 components. Between them, the various transform
blocks must consume all components in the input list
described by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_inputs">Mstage_inputs</A> and produce all components in the output list described
by 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_outputs">Mstage_outputs</A>.

Macro = 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mstage_xforms">Mstage_xforms</A>; Pattern = "(DEP=0,MATRIX=9,DWT=3,MAT=1000)IIII",
[MULTI_RECORD] &mdash; This attribute provides one
record for each transform block, which describes the
type of transform to be implemented in that block and
the parameters of the transform. The first field identifies
the transform as one of "dependency transform" (use
<A HREF="globals.html#Mxform_DEP">Mxform_DEP</A> in source code, or 
<B>DEP</B> when supplying text to be parsed), "decorrelation
matrix transform" (use 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mxform_MATRIX">Mxform_MATRIX</A> in source code, or 
<B>MATRIX</B> when supplying text to be parsed), or "discrete wavelet
transform" (use 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mxform_DWT">Mxform_DWT</A> in source code, or 
<B>DWT</B> when suppling text to be parsed). Do not use the 
<B>MAT</B> option (
<A HREF="globals.html#Mxform_MAT">Mxform_MAT</A> in source code). This option is defined so as to catch
compatibility problems with versions prior to v6.0.
The 
<B>MAT</B> and 
<B>MATRIX</B> options notionally mean the same thing, but prior
to v6.0 Kakadu accidentally used a non-compliant order
for the coefficients in reversible matrix transforms.
To prevent such problems propagating into the future,
Kakadu will explicitly refuse to generate codestreams
which use the 
<B>MAT</B> option, issuing an appropriate error message. It will,
however, digest and decompress codestreams generated
using the old non-compliant syntax. The 2'nd field
of each record holds the instance index of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mtriang_coeffs">Mtriang_coeffs</A> (for dependency transforms) or 
<A HREF="globals.html#Mmatrix_coeffs">Mmatrix_coeffs</A> (for decorrelation matrix transforms) attributes,
which provide the actual transform coefficients, unless
the transform is a DWT; in this last case the 2'nd
field holds 0 (
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels_W9X7">Ckernels_W9X7</A>) for the 9/7 DWT, 1 (
<A HREF="globals.html#Ckernels_W5X3">Ckernels_W5X3</A>) for the 5/3 DWT, or the instance index (in the range
2 to 255) of an 
<B>ATK</B> marker segment whose 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kreversible">Kreversible</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksymmetric">Ksymmetric</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kextension">Kextension</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Ksteps">Ksteps</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Kcoeffs">Kcoeffs</A> attributes describe the DWT kernel. Apart from DWT
transforms, a 0 for this field means that the transform
block just passes its inputs through to its outputs
(setting any extra output components equal to 0) and
adds any offsets specified via the 3'rd field &mdash;
we refer to this as a "null" transform block. The 3'rd
field of each record holds the instance index of the
<A HREF="globals.html#Mvector_coeffs">Mvector_coeffs</A> attribute which describes any offsets to be applied
after inverse transformation of the input components
to the block. A value of 0 for this field means that
there is no offset; otherwise, the value must be in
the range 1 to 255. For DWT transforms, the 4'th field
in the record identifies the number of DWT levels to
be used, in the range 0 to 32, while the final field
holds the transform origin, which plays the same role
as 
<A HREF="globals.html#Sorigin">Sorigin</A>, but along the component axis. For dependency and
decorrelation transforms, the 4'th field must hold
0 if the transform is irreversible, or 1 if it is reversible,
while the 5'th field must hold 0.
