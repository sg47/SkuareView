<P>
In most cases, this is the function you use to actually
write out code-stream data once the subband data has
been generated and encoded. The function may be invoked
multiple times, in order to generate the code-stream
incrementally. This allows you to interleave image
data transformation and encoding steps with code-stream
flushing, avoiding the need to buffer all compressed
data in memory.
</P><P>
 The function provides two modes of operation, as follows:
</P><UL><LI>
Firstly, it may be used to generate quality layers
whose compressed sizes conform to the limits identified
in a supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. This mode of operation is employed if the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> argument is NULL, if the first entry in a non-NULL
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array is 0, or if the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS">KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS</A> flag is present in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#flags">flags</A> argument. In this mode of operation, the function
selects the smallest distortion-length slope threshold
which is consistent with the non-zero layer sizes.
Note that the k'th entry in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array holds the maximum cumulative size of the first
k quality layers, including all code-stream headers,
excepting only the size of optional pointer marker
segments (e.g., PLT and TLM marker segments for recording
packet and/or tile lengths). As explained below, in
this mode of operation, if the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array contains one or more zero-valued entries, the
function effectively synthesizes appropriate values.
</LI><LI>
The function's second mode of operation is triggered
by the presence of a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, whose first entry is non-zero, unless the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS">KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS</A> flag is present. In this mode, the function generates
quality layers based on the distortion-length slope
thresholds supplied in this array. The actual slope
thresholds recorded in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array are 16-bit unsigned integers, whose values are
interpreted as 256*(256-64) + 256*log_2(delta_D/delta_L),
where delta_D is the total squared error distortion
(possibly weighted according to the frequency weights
supplied via the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cband_weights">Cband_weights</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clev_weights">Clev_weights</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cweight">Cweight</A> attributes) associated with an increase of delta_L
in the byte count. It should be noted that distortion
is assessed with respect to normalized sample values,
having a nominal range from -128 to +128, no matter
what the original image bit-depth might have been &mdash;
previous versions of Kakadu erroneously reported the
nominal bit-depth used to assess delta_D here as -0.5
to +0.5, but the actual slope threshold values have
not changed. For the purpose of determining appropriate
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> values, we point out that a threshold of 0 yields
the largest possible output size, i.e., all bytes are
included by the end of that layer. A slope threshold
of 0xFFFF yields the smallest possible output size,
i.e., no code-block contributions are included in the
layer.
</LI><LI>
The function's second mode of operation may be enhanced
by inclusion of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_USES_THRESHOLDS_AND_SIZES">KDU_FLUSH_USES_THRESHOLDS_AND_SIZES</A> flag &mdash; see the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#flags">flags</A> argument. In this case, both the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> values are used. Specifically, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> supplies distortion-length slope thresholds that govern
the amount of data included from each code-block into
each quality layer, except that these thresholds are
automatically reduced (lower threshold means higher
quality) to ensure that the cumulative size of the
first k quality layers is at least as large as the
largest of the first k entries in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array, to the extent that this is possible given the
amount of encoded data. In this modified second mode,
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array provides lower bounds for the amount of data
included in the quality layers, as opposed to upper
bounds. These lower bounds would normally be significantly
smaller than the size that is expected to be produced
based on the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> alone, except if the content turns out to be unusually
compressible. If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__set$1threshold.html">set_min_slope_threshold</A> was used to limit the number of coding passes processed
during compression, the effectiveness of the lower
bounds expressed in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array will be limited by the value that was passed
to that function, so you might want to consider passing
a smaller minimum slope bound than the smallest distortion-length
slope threshold you intend to supply via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array here.
</LI><LI>
The function's first mode of operation may be enhanced
by inclusion of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS">KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS</A> flag &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#flags">flags</A>. In this case, the entries of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array are treated as initial suggestions for the rate
control algorithm to try, while endeavouring to satisy
the size targets found in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. These hints can be used in a video compression
application, supplying the distortion-length slope
thresholds found for one frame as hints for a subsequent
frame &mdash; supplying good hints enhance the computational
efficiency of the rate control process.
</LI></UL><P>
 It should be noted that regardless of which mode of
operation is selected, the quality layers generated
by this function will respect the upper bounds imposed
by any 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> parameter attributes that have been specified &mdash;
see 
<A HREF="cod_params.html">cod_params</A> for a discussion of the interpretation of the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> attribute. However, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Creslengths">Creslengths</A> attributes do not directly constrain the lengths of
the quality layers whose 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> entries are zero, in the function's first mode of
operation.
</P><P>
 Normally, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#num_layer_specs">num_layer_specs</A> should be identical to the actual number of quality
layers to be generated. In this case, every non-zero
entry in a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array identifies the target maximum number of bytes
for the corresponding quality layer and every non-zero
entry in a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array identifies a distortion-length slope threshold
for the corresponding layer.
</P><P>
 It can happen, however, that individual tiles have
fewer quality layers. In this case, these tiles participate
only in the rate allocation associated with the initial
quality layers and they make no contribution to the
later (higher quality) layers. If no tiles have 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#num_layer_specs">num_layer_specs</A> quality layers, the code-stream size will be determined
entirely by the highest 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> entry for which at least one tile has a quality layer.
</P><P>
 It can also happen that individual tiles have more
quality layers than the number of layer specs provided
here. Packets associated with all such layers will
be written with the "empty header bit" set to 0 &mdash;
they will thus have the minimum 1 byte representation.
The function makes an effort to account for these useless
packet bytes, so as to guarantee that the complete
code-stream does not exceed the size specified in a
final layer spec.
</P><P>
 In the function's first mode of operation (see above),
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array is used to size the quality layers. Zero valued
entries in this array mean that the rate allocator
should attempt to assign roughly logarithmically spaced
cumulative sizes to those quality layers. From KDU7.2,
this is accomplished by assigning slope thresholds
to these layers that are uniformly spaced. As explained
above, slope thresholds are expressed in a logarithmic
domain; in practice, this typically yields quality
layers whose sizes are also roughly logarithmically
spaced. Prior to KDU7.2, the unsized layers were explicitly
assigned a size which was then used in the post-compressed
rate-distortion optimization algorithm, but can involve
an unnecessarily large amount of computation when many
layers are involved.
</P><P>
 Any or all of the entries in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array may be 0. If the last entry is 0, all generated
bits will be output by the time the last quality layer
is encountered. In this case, the second last layer,
if it exists and has no specified size, is assigned
an explicit target size based on the logarithmic cumulative
size rule mentioned above.
</P><P>
 If one or more initial entries in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array are 0, the function assigns logarithmic slope
thresholds to these layers which are separated by 300.
In practice, this simple policy usually yields quality
layers whose cumulative sizes are separated from one
another by a factor of approximately sqrt(2). While
this might not appear to be the case at very low qualities,
you should find that after discarding resolution levels
to the point where the quality is appropriate for that
resolution, the relevant quality layers do roughly
satisfy the sqrt(2) rule. In effect, the constant separation
of quality layer slope thresholds produces a set of
quality layers that are well suited to multi-resolution
interactive viewing applications.
</P><P>
 If both the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> arguments are NULL, the function behaves as though
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> pointed to an array having all zero entries, so that
the layer size allocation policy described above will
be employed.
</P><P>
 As noted at the beginning of this description, the
function also supports incremental flushing of the
code-stream. What this means is that you can generate
some of the compressed data, pushing the code-block
bit-streams into the code-stream management machinery
using the 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__open_block.html">kdu_subband::open_block</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__close_block.html">kdu_subband::close_block</A> interfaces, and then call 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> to flush as much of the generated data to the attached
<A HREF="kdu$arget.html">kdu_compressed_target</A> object as possible. You can then continue generating
coded block bit-streams, calling the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function every so often. This behaviour allows you
to minimize the amount of coded data which must be
stored internally. While the idea is quite straightforward,
there are quite a number of important factors which
you should take into account if incremental flushing
is to be beneficial to your application:
</P><UL><LI>
Most significantly, for the Post-Compression-Rate-Distortion
(PCRD) optimization algorithm to work reliably, a large
amount of compressed data must be available for sizing
the various quality layers prior to code-stream generation.
This means that you should generally call the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function as infrequently as possible. In a typical
application, you should process at least 500 lines
of image data between calls to this function and maybe
quite a bit more, depending upon the code-block dimensions
you are using. If you are supplying explicit distortion-length
slope 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> to the function rather than asking for them to be
generated by the PCRD optimization algorithm, you may
call the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function more often, to reduce the amount of compressed
data which must be buffered internally. Note, however,
that the remaining considerations below still apply.
In particular, the tile-part restriction (no more than
255 tile-parts per tile) may still force you to call
the function as infrequently as possible and the dimensions
of the low resolution precincts may render frequent
calls to this function useless, although both of these
constraints go away if the compressed data target is
a structured cache (see 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__get$abilities.html">kdu_compressed_target::get_capabilities</A>).
</LI><LI>
Prior to Kakadu version 7.0, it was particularly important
to call 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> prior to calling this function. Now, this is no longer
critical, because the function effectively invokes
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> internally. In any event if 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> (or an internal equivalent) indicates that no new
data can be written to the code-stream yet, the function
does not generate anything (not even empty tile-parts,
as it used to do prior to v7.0). If the compressed
data target is a sequential codestream (i.e., not a
structured cache), the ability to generate new code-stream
data is affected by the packet progression sequence,
as well as the precinct dimensions, particularly those
of the lower resolution levels. For effective incremental
flushing, you should employ a packet progression order
which sequences all of the packets for each precinct
consecutively. This means that you should use one of
PCRL, CPRL or RPCL. In practice, only the first two
are likely to be of much use, since the packet progression
should also reflect the order in which coded data becomes
available. In most applications, it is best to process
the image components in an interleaved fashion so as
to allow safe utilization of the 
<B>max_bytes</B> function, which limits the number of useless coding
passes which are generated by the block encoder. For
this reason, the PCRL packet progression order will
generally be the one you want. Moreover, it is important
that low resolution precincts have as little height
as possible, since they typically represent the key
bottlenecks preventing smooth incremental flushing
of the code-stream. As an example, suppose you wish
to flush a large image every 700 lines or so, and that
7 levels of DWT are employed. In this case, the height
of the lowest resolution's precincts (these represent
the LL subband) should be around 4 samples. The precinct
height in each successive resolution level can double,
although you should often select somewhat smaller precincts
than this rule would suggest for the highest resolution
levels. For example, you might use the following parameter
values for the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cprecincts">Cprecincts</A> attribute: "{128,256},{128,128},{64,64},{32,64},{16,64},
{8,64},{4,32}".
</LI><LI>
If the image has been vertically tiled, you would do
best to invoke this function after generating compressed
data for a whole number of tiles. In this case, careful
construction of vertical precinct dimensions, as suggested
above, is not necessary, since the tiles will automatically
induce an hierarchically descending set of precinct
dimensions.
</LI><LI>
You should be aware of the fact that each call to this
function (apart from one issued at a point when 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> would return false) adds a new tile-part to each tile
whose compressed data has not yet been completely written.
The standard imposes a limit of at most 255 tile-parts
for any tile, so if the image is not tiled, you must
call this function no more than 255 times.
</LI><LI>
If your compressed data target is a structured cache
(see 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__get$abilities.html">kdu_compressed_target::get_capabilities</A>), you can ignore most of the above constraints/suggestions,
because precincts can be written in any order at all.
In this case, the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Corder">Corder</A> attribute is irrelevant and tiles are not divided
into multiple tile-parts. You do still need to set
up the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cprecincts">Cprecincts</A> attribute, but you do not need to force the lowest
resolution precincts to be very small. A reasonable
configuration, for a flush period of 1024, would be
"Cprecincts={256,256},{128,256},{64,256}", which can
be used with an arbitrarily large value of 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clevels">Clevels</A>.
</LI><LI>
You can arrange for this function to be automatically
invoked at regular intervals (determined by internally
meaningful trigger-points) by using the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__auto_flush.html">auto_flush</A> function. This is highly recommended, especially for
multi-threading environments.
</LI></UL><P>
 We conclude this introductory discussion by noting
the way in which values are taken in from and returned
via any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> arrays when the function is invoked one or more times.
When the function is first invoked, the mode of operation
is determined to be either size driven (first mode
of operation), or threshold driven (second mode of
operation), depending upon whether or not a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array is supplied having a non-zero first entry and
whether or not the 
<B>KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINS</B> flag is present. If the size driven mode of operation
is in force, the target layer sizes are copied to an
internal array and the same overall layer size targets
are used for this and all subsequent calls to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function until the code-stream has been entirely flushed;
it makes no difference what values are supplied in
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array for subsequent 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> calls in an incremental flushing sequence. If the
threshold-driven mode is in force, the supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> values copies to an internal array and the same mode
is employed for all future calls to this function until
the code-stream has been completely flushed. However,
in this case, if subsequent calls to this function
provide a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, the supplied thresholds will replace those
stored in the internal array. This allows the application
to implement its own rate control loop, adapting the
slope thresholds between incremental 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> calls so as to achieve some objective. If the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_USES_THRESHOLDS_AND_SIZES">KDU_FLUSH_USES_THRESHOLDS_AND_SIZES</A> flag is present in the first call to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function, and the threshold-driven mode of operation
is in force, both the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> and the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> arrays are copied internally, so as to preserve the
layer size lower bounds, and only the thresholds may
be changed by subsequent calls to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function.
</P><P>
 Regardless of the mode of operation, whenever this
function returns, it copies into any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array, the total number of bytes which have actually
been written out to the code-stream so far for each
specified layer. Similarly, whenever the function returns,
it copies into any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, the actual slope threshold used when generating
code-stream data for each layer during this call.
</P><P>
 Note that internal state information is transferred
to a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array and/or a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, even if the function does not actually write
any new codestream content (i.e., even if 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> would have returned false).

 By default, the rate allocation logic performs an
additional trimming step when constructing the final
(highest rate) quality layer. In this trimming step,
the distortion-length slope threshold is selected so
as to just exceed the maximum target size and the allocator
then works back through the code-blocks, starting from
the highest resolution ones, trimming the extra code-bytes
which would be included by this excessively small slope
threshold, until the rate target is satisfied.

exactly the same way as all the other layers. This
can be useful for several reasons: 1) it can improve
the execution speed slightly; 2) it ensures that the
final distortion-length slopes which are returned via
a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array can be used in a subsequent compression step
(e.g., compressing the same image or a similar image

If true, the rate-distortion slope and the target number
of bytes associated with each quality layer will be
recorded in a COM (comment) marker segment in the main
code-stream header. This can be very useful for applications
which wish to process the code-stream later in a manner
which depends upon the interpretation of the quality
layers. For this reason, you should generally set this
argument to true, unless you want to get the smallest
possible file size when compressing small images. If
the function is called multiple times to effect incremental
code-stream flushing, the parameters recorded in the
COM marker segment will be extrapolated from the information
available when the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function is first called. The information in this
comment is thus generally to be taken more as indicative
than absolutely accurate.

This argument is ignored unless quality layer generation
is being driven by layer sizes, supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. In this case, it may be used to trade accuracy
for speed when determining the distortion-length slopes
which achieve the target layer sizes as closely as
possible. In particular, the algorithm will finish
once it has found a distortion-length slope which yields
a size in the range target*(1-tolerance) &lt;= size
&lt;= target, where target is the target size for the
relevant layer. If no such slope can be found, the
layer is assigned a slope such that the size is as
close as possible to target, without exceeding it.

Additional flags that may control the behaviour of
this function. Currently the only flags that are defined
are:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS">KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS</A> &mdash; this flag causes any non-zero slope thresholds
supplied via a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array to be re-interpreted as "hints" to the rate-control
machinery, as to good values to try first when hunting
for distortion-length slope thresholds that will satisfy
the cumulative target compressed sizes supplied via
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> is NULL or contains all zeros, the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> hints are not relevant. Video compression applications
provide good opportunities for this hinting process,
since the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> discovered during the compression of one frame may
be used as hints for a subsequent frame.
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_USES_THRESHOLDS_AND_SIZES">KDU_FLUSH_USES_THRESHOLDS_AND_SIZES</A> &mdash; this flag is ignored unless this is the first
call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A>, with 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> both non-NULL, the first entry of the 
<B>layer_thressholds</B> array is non-zero, and the 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS">KDU_FLUSH_THRESHOLDS_ARE_HINTS</A> flag is not present. Under these conditions, the function's
second mode of operation is in effect and the values
passed via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array are interpreted as lower bounds on the sizes
of the generated quality layers. Specifically, in this
case 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A>[k] is interpreted as a lower bound on the cumulative
number of bytes associated with the first k quality
layers, meaning that the distortion-length slope threshold
found at 
<B>slope_thresholds</B>[k] should be decreased as required to ensure that
at least this many bytes are generated. In this case,
each call to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function will return the possibly adjusted distortion-length
slope values that were actually used.
