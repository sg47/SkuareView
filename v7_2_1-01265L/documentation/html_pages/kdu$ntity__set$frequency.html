Since it could be very disruptive for a thread to be
pre-empted by the operating system at an arbitrary
point, worker threads explicitly yield their execution
context periodically, at points where this is not likely
to be disruptive. This allows other tasks to be performed
by the operating system, so that once a thread's time
slice expires it is likely to be rescheduled immediately.
</P><P>
 This function allows you to control the frequency
with which threads yield their execution back to the
operating system. It is not completely clear how expensive
or how extensive thread yielding actually is. If the
operating system has no other work pending, a context
switch will probably not occur. In any case, this is
at least a moderately expensive system call, so one
should probably avoid yield frequencies close to 1.
On the other hand, if yielding is too infrequent it
may be ineffective. For example, consider a video processing
application in which other threads (not managed by
this object) are responsible for frame refresh and/or
image I/O being performed at regular intervals. One
would like to be sure that at least one thread yields
its execution at least once per frame period so that
the application's processing pipeline does not get
starved or over-full, causing a lot of threads to go
idle. The 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__get$unt_stats.html">get_job_count_stats</A> function can be used to estimate reasonable yield
frequencies, as explained in the description of that
function.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that threads which are doing work
while inside the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A> function do not yield execution as a result of doing
jobs, since this might be disruptive. This necessarily
means that the group owner thread (the one that invoked
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__create.html">create</A>) never explicitly yields its execution &mdash; although
you can do this yourself if you like. This means that
the present function only affects worker threads &mdash;
those created using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A>.

Typical number of jobs executed by a worker thread
(not inside 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__wai$condition.html">wait_for_condition</A>) before it invokes the 
<A HREF="kdu_thread__yield.html">kdu_thread::yield</A> function. Calls to this function do not synchronize
thread yield events, so over time the yield instances
will become randomized; this is probably a good thing.
</P><P>
 It is legal to supply a value of 0 for this argument,
in which case explicit yielding is suspended.
</P><P>
 The default yield frequency is currently 100, but
that might be too high for systems with lots of threads
or which require frequent attention to other work.
