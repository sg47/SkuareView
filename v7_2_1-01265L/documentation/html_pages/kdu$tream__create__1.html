Constructs the internal code-stream management machinery,
to be accessed via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface and its close relatives, 
<A HREF="kdu_tile.html">kdu_tile</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$_comp.html">kdu_tile_comp</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ution.html">kdu_resolution</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$bband.html">kdu_subband</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct.html">kdu_precinct</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_block.html">kdu_block</A>.
</P><P>
 We refer to the machinery created by this particular
version of the overloaded 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> function as an 
<B>output codestream</B>, for want of more appropriate terminology. The function
prepares the internal machinery for generation of a
new JPEG2000 code-stream. This is required by applications
which need to compress an image, or applications which
need to transcode an existing compressed image into
a new one. In any event, the distinguishing features
of this version of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> function are that it requires a compressed data 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#target">target</A> object and that it requires a 
<A HREF="siz_params.html">siz_params</A> object, identifying the dimensional properties (image
component dimensions and related info) which establish
the structural configuration of a JPEG2000 code-stream.
</P><P>
 Once this function returns, you will generally want
to invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__access_siz.html">access_siz</A> function to gain access to the complete parameter
sub-system created here. With the returned pointer,
you can perform any specific parameter configuration
tasks of interest to your application. You should then
invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu_params__fin$lize_all__1.html">kdu_params::finalize_all</A> function on the pointer returned by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__access_siz.html">access_siz</A>, so as to finalize your parameter settings. Thereafter,
you should make no further parameter changes. It is
best to do these things before calling any other member
functions of this object, but definitely before using
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__open_tile.html">open_tile</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get_dims.html">get_dims</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$tile_dims.html">get_tile_dims</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bsampling.html">get_subsampling</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$istration.html">get_registration</A> function. The behaviour could otherwise be unreliable.
</P><P>
 The function is deliberately not implemented as a
constructor, since robust exception handlers might
not always be able to clean up partially constructed
objects if an error condition is thrown from within
a constructor (as a general rule, constructors are
the least robust place to do significant work). For
safety, this function should never be invoked on a
non-empty 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface (one whose 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__exists.html">exists</A> function returns true).
</P><P>
 Starting from Kakadu v4.3, this function includes
three optional arguments which may be used to control
the generation of codestream fragments. This allows
applications to compress absolutely enormous images
(easily into the tens or hundreds of tera-pixels) in
pieces, putting all the pieces together automatically.
To access this facility, the following notes should
be heeded:
</P><UL><LI>
Each fragment must consist of a whole number of tiles.
</LI><LI>
The 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#siz">siz</A> parameters identify the dimensions of the entire image,
while 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_region">fragment_region</A> supplies the location and dimensions of the region
represented by the collection of tiles which you are
compressing in the current fragment.
</LI><LI>
Once 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> returns, you need to configure the coding parameters
exactly as you would normally, calling 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__access_siz.html">access_siz</A> to access the parameter sub-system, and filling in
whatever non-default coding parameters are of interest.
The parameter subsystem must be configured fully, as
if you were compressing all tiles at once, and it must
be configured in exactly the same way for each fragment,
except that you need only provide tile-specific parameters
when you are compressing the fragment which contains
those tiles. If you provide tile-specific parameters
for other tiles, they will be ignored.
</LI><LI>
You must indicate the number of tiles which have been
already compressed in all previous fragments, via the
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tiles_generated">fragment_tiles_generated</A> argument. A main header will be written only when
generating the first fragment &mdash; i.e., the one
for which 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tiles_generated">fragment_tiles_generated</A> is 0. An EOC marker will be appended only to the last
fragment &mdash; the system can figure out that you
are compressing the last fragment, by adding the number
of tiles represented by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_region">fragment_region</A> to the number which have already been generated, and
comparing this with the total number of tiles in the
entire image. See also the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__is_$_fragment.html">is_last_fragment</A> function.
</LI><LI>
You must indicate the number of tile bytes which have
been previously generated, via 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tile_bytes_generated">fragment_tile_bytes_generated</A>. This value corresponds to the cumulative length of
all generated fragments so far, excluding only the
main header. After generating a fragment, you may discover
the number of tile bytes generated for that fragment
by calling the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$tal_bytes.html">get_total_bytes</A> function, with the 
<B>exclude_main_header</B> argument set to false. You will have to add the values
generated for all previous fragments yourself.
</LI><LI>
If you want TLM marker segments to be generated for
you (this is generally a very good idea when compressing
huge images), the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#target">target</A> object will need to support the functionality represented
by 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__sta$t_rewrite.html">kdu_compressed_target::start_rewrite</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__end_rewrite.html">kdu_compressed_target::end_rewrite</A>. Moreover, you will have to make sure that these functions
can be used to backtrack into the main header to insert
TLM information. This means that it must generally
be possible to backtrack to a position prior to the
start of the current fragment. The simplest way to
implement this is by passing a single open 
<A HREF="kdu$arget.html">kdu_compressed_target</A> object into the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html">create</A> function associated with each fragment, closing it
only once all fragments have been written. However,
by clever implementation of the 
<A HREF="kdu$arget.html">kdu_compressed_target</A> interface, your application can arrange to place the
fragments in separate files if you like.
</LI><LI>
It is possible to implement a 
<A HREF="kdu$arget.html">kdu_compressed_target</A> object in such a way that you can process multiple
fragments concurrently. This might appear to be impossible,
since the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tile_bytes_generated">fragment_tile_bytes_generated</A> cannot be known until all previous fragments have
been processed completely, suggesting that you will
have to process them in sequence. However, the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tile_bytes_generated">fragment_tile_bytes_generated</A> value is actually used only to compute the location
of the TLM marker segments relative to the current
location. This means that you can actually supply fake
values for 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tile_bytes_generated">fragment_tile_bytes_generated</A> so long as your implementation of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#target">target</A> object can correctly interpret 
<A HREF="kdu$arget__sta$t_rewrite.html">kdu_compressed_target::start_rewrite</A> calls based on these fake 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_tile_bytes_generated">fragment_tile_bytes_generated</A> values, as references to specific locations in the
first fragment.
</LI><LI>
All public interface functions offered by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object, or any of its descendants (
<A HREF="kdu_tile.html">kdu_tile</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$_comp.html">kdu_tile_comp</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ution.html">kdu_resolution</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$bband.html">kdu_subband</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu_block.html">kdu_block</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$cinct.html">kdu_precinct</A>, etc.) will behave exactly as though you were compressing
an image whose location and dimensions on the canvas
were equal to those identified by 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__create__1.html#fragment_region">fragment_region</A>. This means that almost every aspect of an application
can be ignorant of whether it is compressing an entire
image or just a fragment. Amongst other things, this
also means that the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$lid_tiles.html">get_valid_tiles</A> member function returns only the range of tiles which
are associated with this fragment and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get_dims.html">get_dims</A> returns only the dimensions of the fragment. The only
exceptions are the 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__get_tnum.html">kdu_tile::get_tnum</A> function, which returns the true index of a tile,
as it will appear within the final code-stream, and
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__is_$_fragment.html">kdu_codestream::is_last_fragment</A> function, which indicates whether or not the present
fragment is the terminal one. This is required in order
to access tile-specific elements of the coding parameter
sub-system (see 
<A HREF="kdu_params.html">kdu_params</A>). The coding parameter sub-system is ignorant of fragmentation.
